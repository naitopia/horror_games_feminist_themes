Alice: Madness Returns,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%3A_Madness_Returns," Alice: Madness Returns is a 2011 action-adventure game developed by Spicy Horse and released by Electronic Arts for Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . The game is the sequel to American McGee's Alice (2000) and was directed by series creator American McGee . This is the last game designed by McGee before his retirement from gaming industry in 2023. Alice: Madness Returns follows Alice Liddell , a young woman suffering from trauma caused by the death of her family in a fire. Alice was discharged from a psychiatric clinic and now lives in an orphanage for mentally traumatized orphans under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby. To get rid of the trauma and learn the truth about her past, she once again falls into Wonderland , where a new evil force has corrupted it. The game received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. American McGee had made several attempts to start production of another sequel. In 2023, EA, which owns rights to the franchise, rejected the pitch. McGee announced that he is no longer interested in continuing the franchise, ultimately leaving the game development industry. Alice: Madness Returns is played from a third-person perspective and also the gameplay have elements of hack 'n' slash , platformer and puzzles . The player controls Alice for the entirety of the game for running, jumping, dodging, attacking, and shrinking. In combat, Alice gains a small number of weapons that can be utilized in several ways. Her primary weapon is the Vorpal Blade , a decorated kitchen knife. The remainder of her arsenal is somewhat akin to the benign and mundane items that take on a deadly quality in Alice's tainted Wonderland in the first game. The Pepper Grinder becomes a crank operated Gatling gun, used to attack at a distance and pepper pig snouts. The Hobby Horse is used as a sledgehammer to inflict heavy damage and break barriers and defenses. The Teapot Cannon fires tea sieves that explode to cause heavy damage and, like the Hobby Horse, break barriers. By collecting teeth that are dropped by foes or found scattered about the levels, the player can upgrade these items to more powerful versions. Two other weapons cannot be upgraded, primarily because they are more defensive than directly offensive: the Umbrella acts as a shield that can be used to deflect and reflect most incoming projectiles; The Clockwork Bomb is a time-delayed/remote-controlled rabbit alarm clock that does a minimal amount of damage to enemies, but its usefulness is better illustrated as a decoy, as well as a weight to keep switches temporarily depressed. Alice's health is tracked by a number of rose petals. Should Alice's health fall to zero during gameplay, the player is forced to start at the most recent checkpoint. They can also regenerate health by going into giant purple flowers. Falling off platforms into bottomless pits or dangerous liquids do not damage Alice but restart her at a nearby platform. The game also introduces Hysteria , which can be used when Alice's health is very low, and it can only be used for a limited amount of time. While working on each level, the player can discover various secrets. A primary mechanic is to use Alice's shrinking potion to reduce in size, allowing her to walk through small spaces like keyholes, but also reveals invisible platforms and surfaces; after returning to normal size, these platforms slowly fade back to invisibility, requiring the player to remember their location. Pig's snouts, which make noise when the player is close, can be struck with the pepper grinder to reveal new paths. Radula rooms provide a short challenge to the player, which on completion grants a jar of paint; obtaining four jars earns the player another rose for Alice's health. Memories can be picked up that provide voiceovers revealing parts of the game's backstory. Upon completion, the player can start a new game plus , letting them play through the game again but keeping all their weapons and upgrades from the previous attempt. From the menu, the player can also review the memories that they have found within the game. Within events of the first game , Alice Liddell , believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland . While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts and was eventually released from the ward. Madness Returns takes place in 1875, a year after Alice's release. Alice, now 19 years old, resides at an orphanage in Victorian London , under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland. During an errand, Alice is struck by a hallucination and believes herself to be in Wonderland again. Though initially idyllic, the peaceful land quickly becomes corrupted by an entity called the Infernal Train that rampages through it, leaving behind the Ruin, a force that attempts to stop Alice. Alice meets with the Cheshire Cat , who affirms that it is some outside force, not Alice, that has caused this corruption, and urges her to seek out former friends and foes to discover the source of the Train. Throughout the rest of the game, Alice briefly returns to reality between episodes occurring within Wonderland. In the real world, Alice learns from the family solicitor, Wilton J. Radcliffe, that her older sister, Elizabeth (nicknamed ""Lizzie""), was the first to die in the fire, despite being the farthest from its source, and had been locked in her room. Within the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the Duchess , the Mad Hatter , the March Hare and the Dormouse , the Mock Turtle , the Walrus and the Carpenter , the Caterpillar , and the White King . She is ultimately told that the Queen of Hearts still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in a diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self. The Queen reveals that an entity called the Dollmaker created the Infernal Train and is the one corrupting Wonderland. Returning to London, Alice starts to recall her memories of the night of the fire and realizes that Dr. Bumby is responsible for the deaths of her sister and her whole family. She comes to the conclusion that Dr. Bumby is attempting to erase the memories of the fire from her mind and, as he has done with other children, trying to leave her (and the orphans) as ""blank toys"" to be taken by abusive masters and child molesters for a price. Furious, Alice confronts both Dr. Bumby in the real world at the Moorgate station and the Dollmaker, Dr. Bumby's Wonderland counterpart, in her fantasy on the Infernal Train. Dr. Bumby admits to his crimes and even attests to setting Alice's home on fire after Lizzie refused his advances, removing any witnesses to having raped her that night. He points out that by wiping out her Wonderland, he will make her forget the events of that night, while he continues as a member of high society and secretly sells young children for prostitution. Alice defeats the Dollmaker in Wonderland, giving her the strength in the real world and in her mind to push Dr. Bumby into the path of an oncoming train, killing him. As Alice leaves the station, she finds herself in a hybrid vision of London mixed with Wonderland, Londerland. Alice wanders into the unknown terrain as the Cheshire Cat monologues that Alice has found the truth that was ""worth the pain fighting for"", and Wonderland, though damaged, is safe for the time being. Rumors of a sequel to Alice first developed shortly after the original game was released to critical and commercial success, though at that time, the development team behind the original were working on the ultimately-canceled spin-off, American McGee's Oz . As the development of the movie adaptation of American McGee's Alice took longer and the original game became more of a cult classic, in 2007 interest at Electronic Arts rose in a remake of the game and work was started on a sequel. However, when the movie adaptation fell through, plans for a sequel were shelved, and remained so for nearly a decade. At the February 2009 D.I.C.E. Summit , EA announced a sequel, which at the time had the working title The Return of American McGee's Alice . Two pieces of concept art accompanied the announcement, along with the information that the original game's writer and executive producer would also return for the sequel. In November of that year, a fan-made trailer (with the title ""The Return of Alice"") was mistaken by gaming news outlets as an official teaser for the game, in which Alice is in therapy after a relapse nine months following the events of the first game, and appears to hallucinate an image of the Cheshire Cat in place of her doctor. At EA's Studio Showcase in July 2010, more details about the game were shown, including its current title, Alice: Madness Returns . In addition to further pieces of concept art and actual, in-game screenshots, the first official teaser was released. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fan video eight months prior, it also portrays Alice in therapy: after being hypnotized by her doctor in a bizarre office filled with prosthetic arms hanging from the ceiling, as she opens her mouth to speak, large amounts of blood and teeth pour out. As the game title appears, a whispering voice is heard saying, ""What have you done?"" During the 2010 Tokyo Game Show , new assets, including a second trailer, were released. Alice is seen strolling through a London street, and eventually approaches an area littered with toys and a toy store window, which contains a set depicting the Mad Hatter , the Dormouse and the March Hare taking tea. Suddenly, she sees an image of her deceased parents in the window's reflection but turns around to find no one there. The window begins to burn and the silhouette of the Queen of Hearts appears before it explodes in flames, and the Queen's tentacles drag Alice into the inferno. Like the previous trailer, it ends with a voice saying ""What have you done?"" On February 14, 2011, MSNBC 's ""In-Game"" website unveiled the third teaser trailer as well as a brief interview with American McGee regarding the game. The third teaser depicts Alice wandering around an initially beautiful Wonderland, eventually coming across the Caterpillar , who transforms into a giant, menacing butterfly as the landscape is attacked by fiery phoenixes and turned into a nightmarish world reminiscent of the original game's landscapes. Alice finds herself sitting at a tea party with the Mad Hatter, March Hare and Dormouse. The Hatter sends a robotic teapot to kill Alice, who in turns stabs it to death in the eye with the Vorpal Blade. Then, a voice asks ""What have you done?"" A fourth trailer, showing gameplay footage for the first time was released on March 4, 2011. The trailer featured possible gameplay in Victorian London, new costumes and weapons for Alice, the reprised roles of some of the voice cast from the first game, and the appearance of old and new characters including a resurrected Jabberwock and the Dodo ; after the trailer the Cheshire Cat says ""Now it's time to put your blade to work"". The player can also hear Alice's Vorpal Blade being equipped as the title card comes up. GameSpot released footage of a gameplay demo whilst interviewing an EA executive producer Joel Wade in April. In the video, numerous details about the game were revealed. Wade explained storywise after Alice left Rutledge Asylum, she is an orphan and now lives in an orphanage, and the home's director is helping her. Gameplay showed Alice can unlock and use several weapons, which can be upgraded by collecting teeth throughout the game. Weapons including the Vorpal Blade, the Pepper Grinder which acts as a projectile machine gun -like weapon, the Clockwork Bomb, the club-like Hobby Horse, and the explosive Teapot Cannon. Alice also collects ""memories"" that are part of her quest to recall forgotten memories from her past. Enemies are described as having ""puzzle elements"", namely their weak point which the player must figure out to defeat them. On May 20, 2011, a prequel to Madness Returns , titled Alice: Madness Returns Interactive Story , was released as an app exclusively for iOS . A port for Android phones was developed. The app plays like a book that requires you to interact with illustrations and at many times allows you to play mini-games. The story covers the events even before the original game all the way to the events directly before Alice: Madness Returns . On June 3, 2011, a final launch trailer was released. This showed some bosses, Alice fighting enemies, the Cheshire Cat giving Alice hints, and more. At the time of release, Madness Returns had a final development budget of $9 million. In 2013, American McGee admitted that he wished he had had more time to polish the game by compressing the action, removing a lot of the ""filler"" content and fixing some of the annoying bugs. The soundtrack was released digitally for promotional purposes on 17 May 2011. Clothing was screen-printed and showcased through t-shirts. Action figurines of Alice, Card Guards and the Cheshire Cat were distributed by Diamond Select Toys, as of San-Diego Comic-Con 2011 there was an exclusive Minimate of Alice released. In 2011, Epic Weapons released both the Alice: Madness Returns Vorpal Blade and the Vorpal Blade mini set for kids. Along with the Vorpal blade, there was a packaged deal with the American McGee's Alice Vorpal Blade that came with the display stand, originally sold separately. For a special edition replica, ' Alice: Madness Return Teapot' was sold by Epic Weapons as a fully functional teapot, based off the creature 'Eyepot' within the game. Mysterious , American McGee's fashion brand, created 'Chaos' symbol related accessories, including necklaces and wallets. The official artbook of Alice: Madness Returns ""The Art of Alice: Madness Returns"" written by R.J. Berg, was released on 17 May 2011, complete with concept ideas and character designs. Art prints are available through Mysterious and have been created over years by several different artists, also to be signed by American McGee when purchased. Merchandise from Alice: Madness Returns is still purchasable as of the 2020s via McGee's company Mysterious. The artbook of Alice: Otherlands, was released on 30 October 2015 along with several digital assets on Kickstarter for being unable to sell physical copies once the campaign had ended. The artbook is available through direct download and is accessible through the Internet Archive . In 2023, on Patreon and released to the public via YouTube , American McGee posted 5 tracks of ' Alice: Asylum Conceptual Music & Soundscape Experiments ' which was arranged by Alex Crowley and used for narrative inspiration during pre-production . In the description of the video, McGee goes into further detail and explains the meaning behind each track. Since Alice: Asylum was not completed, McGee has allowed fans to download the full Alice: Asylum design bible of concepts, pitches and character designs for free on Patreon. Several designs for casual clothing were created but never came to fruition. Alice: Asylum embroidery patches of several characters became available through Mysterious. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Windows version 74% based on 15 reviews and 75/100 based on 29 reviews, the Xbox 360 version 73% based on 49 reviews and 70/100 based on 67 reviews, and the PlayStation 3 version 71% based on 35 reviews and 70/100 based on 52 reviews. Alice Liang from 1Up.com gave the game a B−, praising the platforming and controls but felt the game did not live up to its full potential, stating: ""Sadly, Alice: Madness Returns provides a visually interesting world, with competent gameplay mechanics, but it ultimately fails to completely draw the player into the depths of its promised insanity to satisfaction."" GamesRadar+ included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that it was a worthy sequel yet also felt that players would have to overlook problems to enjoy its qualities. The release of the game played into the resurgence of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland popularity of the late 2000s to the early 2010s, this was sparked further by the Tim Burton film Alice in Wonderland (2010). The first game: Alice focuses on the late 1990s grunge movement with its soundtrack and use of industrial visuals, whilst Alice: Madness Returns indulges onto its steampunk aesthetics opposed to the basis of goth subculture . Steampunk is used as a key visual effect, this in turn changed various characters designs and fighting enemies became more complicated. This is in part to development periods and the years between the games releases. With mixed reviews over several years, Alice: Madness Return s, over time has stayed consistent as an 'underrated masterpiece' within internet culture since its initial release with a cult following. The legacy of Alice: Madness Returns proves to remain more popular then that of its predecessor and it continues to live on through social media platforms specifically that of TikTok and Twitch . American McGee has stated that he had envisioned the Alice series as a trilogy. In May 2011, McGee reported that a story had already been created for a potential third game, but stressed that it would only be produced if the audience desired it. In June 2012, McGee reiterated his intention to develop a third game, titled Alice in Otherland . McGee revealed that the game would be released episodically , and stated that it ""would allow Alice to go into the minds of all these characters she encounters, and it opens up the possibility where you could play as Alice and you can enter into a player's mind, change the landscape, and then basically psychologically adjust the character in doing so. Imagine an MMO where the missions aren't locations, but they're people."" However, he said that the game was unlikely to be produced soon due to a lack of interest from Electronic Arts. On March 14, 2013, McGee posted on his Facebook page that he would have the opportunity to discuss a third Alice game with EA during the Game Developers Conference . He did not specify whether or not this would follow the desired plot of Alice in Otherland , but claimed that the funding for the project would most possibly be done through Kickstarter . On July 15, 2013, McGee announced that a campaign for the production has begun on Kickstarter to help fund the project, titled Alice: Otherlands , a series of animated film shorts. To help promote the campaign, McGee released a video on his personal YouTube and Vimeo accounts, explaining the concept of Alice: Otherlands and how the funds will affect the production of the film. The video can also be viewed on its Kickstarter website. Alice: Otherlands successfully reached its Kickstarter goal on August 4. On August 21, McGee confirmed that the campaign has achieved its ""stretch goal"" to secure Susie Brann's (Alice's voice actress) and Roger L. Jackson 's (the Cheshire Cat's voice actor) involvement on the project with an extra $50,000. To award the backers who donated to the project, McGee gave special merchandises, such as autographed posters, digital copies of the DVD and art book to those who donated $500 or more. Additionally, all backers had their names added to the credits of the film. Due to legal constraints, DVDs and Blu-rays were available for backers only, while the short films were distributed digitally for the public for free on various digital formats. An art book titled The Art of Alice: Otherlands was developed by artist Alex ""AlexCee"" Crowley. Originally, Alice: Otherlands was set to be released sometime in December 2014, but has been pushed back due to production delays. On October 30, 2015, the digital assets for Alice: Otherlands were released on various streaming platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, and are available for download on the official site. According to McGee, Alice, now 20 years old, will enter the minds of two famous historical figures, Richard Wagner and Jules Verne , and discover the horrors of the human subconscious. Alice will learn of an ""insidious evil lurking in every corner of Victorian London"" with the intent of capturing its inhabitants in a nightmarish ""prison of the mind"". The two film shorts vary in length, have their own unique animation style, and a different soundtrack composed by Chris Vrenna and Walter Sickert and the Army of Broken Toys. In several interviews, McGee expressed his desire to make Alice: Otherlands into a video game as originally planned, but stated that will depend entirely on the overall success of the animated shorts. He also stated that EA has recently started to show more interest in making an Alice sequel again, but it all depends on the success of Alice: Otherlands and Spicy Horse games. In September 2017, American McGee announced that he was working on a license proposal for the third installment of the Alice franchise, tentatively titled Alice: Asylum . McGee explains that his license proposal would consist of ""artwork, design outline, and financial/business model"" which has been sent to EA in July 2018. The pitch deck was being partially funded through the membership platform Patreon before being cancelled in April 2023 after Electronic Arts rejected the design bible pitch . Furthermore, McGee announced that he is no longer interested in pursuing future projects regarding the Alice franchise, even if EA were to reconsider their stance with production of the game.",Spicy Horse,"NA : June 14, 2011 [ 2 ] EU : June 16, 2011 [ 1 ] JP : July 21, 2011 [ 3 ]",Windows PlayStation 3 Xbox 360,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,,family,asylum; hallucinate; hallucination; trauma,memories,escape; locked; prison,kill; rape; raped,forced; rape; raped,creature; evil; witch,young,
Alien: Isolation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation," Alien: Isolation is a 2014 survival horror game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega for PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Windows , Xbox 360 , and Xbox One . Based on the Alien film series, the game is set 15 years after the original 1979 film , and follows the engineer Amanda Ripley , voiced by Andrea Deck . Amanda investigates the disappearance of her mother, Ellen Ripley , aboard the space station Sevastopol, which is in disarray due to years of corporate negligence and the threat of a rampant alien creature. The game emphasizes stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid, outsmart, and fight various enemies with equipment such as firearms , a motion tracker , stun baton , and a flamethrower . Alien: Isolation was designed to resemble the original Alien film rather than its more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens , and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future could look like. It runs on an engine built to accommodate the alien's behaviour and technical aspects such as atmospheric and lighting effects. Creative Assembly intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but used first-person to create a more intense experience. Several downloadable content packs were released, some of which relive scenes from the original film. Alien: Isolation received positive reviews and sold over two million copies by May 2015. Its retro-futuristic art direction, sound design, and artificial intelligence were praised, while its length received some criticism. Considered one of the best games ever made , Alien: Isolation won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards . It saw ports to Linux and OS X in 2015, Nintendo Switch in 2019, and Android and iOS mobile devices in 2021. It was also added to the Amazon Luna service in 2021. A web series adaptation was released in 2019. In 2024, Creative Assembly announced that a sequel was in development. Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure game with an emphasis on stealth and survival horror . The player controls Amanda Ripley from a first-person perspective, and must explore a space station and complete mission objectives to progress forward in the story while avoiding, outsmarting, and defeating enemies. Specific objectives vary across each of the nineteen missions, but can range from activating computers, talking to NPCs , collecting certain items or reaching specific areas. The player can run, climb ladders, sneak into vents, crouch behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and peek over or lean around for a safe view. The player also has the ability to go under tables or inside empty lockers and cabinets to hide from enemies. Amanda encounters various enemies throughout the station, including hostile human survivors and androids . The player can either eliminate them or avoid them using stealth or distractions. The main antagonist, the Alien (or otherwise referred to by the game's characters as ""The Creature""), appears briefly during certain sections across the first four missions, but begins continuously pursuing the player after the completion of mission five, ""The Quarantine"". The Alien cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the Alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the Alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the Alien finding the player. For example, if the Alien is close enough, it will be attracted by the tracker's sound, forcing the player to use the tracker wisely and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine if the Alien is up in the ducts or on ground level. On the game's hardest difficulty setting, Nightmare, the motion tracker is unreliable and the in game mini-map , used to navigate and locate objectives, is unavailable. Although Amanda gains access to a revolver , shotgun , bolt gun , flamethrower , and stun baton over the course of the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing limited ammunition. The player can also craft useful items by collecting schematics and different materials. Items include EMP detonators, noisemakers, molotov cocktails , and pipe bombs ; these can help the player deal with enemies. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in a particular direction. The Alien is afraid of fire , so using flame weapons will force it to temporarily retreat. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies; health is restored with medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory, although all of the Alien's attacks (unless it is retreating) will result in instant death. The space station is divided into sections connected by trams and elevators. Some doors require certain actions before entry is allowed; for example, some require a keycard or entry codes, while others need to be hacked by an access tuner or cut open with a welding torch . Computer terminals and rewiring stations can be used to access information and trigger actions such as disabling security cameras or manipulating the station's air-purification and alarm mechanism. These actions may help to momentarily divert the attention away from the player's position. To save game progress, the player needs to locate a save station terminal and insert Amanda's access card. There is a three second pause before the save can be completed, meaning the player can be killed while attempting to save. If Amanda dies, the player will have to restart from the last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a special mode, called Survivor Mode, in which the player must complete objectives within a time limit on different challenge maps while being hunted by the Alien. In 2137, fifteen years after her mother Ellen went missing onboard the USCSS Nostromo , Amanda Ripley learns from Weyland-Yutani android Christopher Samuels that the Nostromo ' s flight recorder has been recovered and taken to Sevastopol, a space station owned by Seegson Corporation which orbits the gas giant KG-348 in the Zeta Reticuli system. Samuels offers Amanda a place on the retrieval team to give her closure, and she accepts. Amanda, Samuels and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to the station via the USCSS Torrens with the help of the ship's captain Diane Verlaine. After finding the station too damaged to dock, the trio attempt to enter it via a spacewalk , but their EVA line is severed by an explosion, and Amanda is separated from the others. Making her way through the station, Amanda discovers that it has descended into chaos due the presence of a hostile alien creature onboard. She eventually finds the flight recorder, but discovers that its data has been corrupted. Amanda then makes her way to Samuels and Taylor; retrieving medical supplies for an injured Taylor, she meets Marshal Waits and follows him back to his bureau. There, Amanda meets the imprisoned captain of the USCSS Anesidora , Henry Marlow, who explains he recovered the flight recorder and went to LV-426 , where his wife was impregnated by a facehugger before she fatally birthed the creature on Sevastopol. Waits convinces Amanda to lure the creature to one of the station's modules, where it can be ejected into space. However, Waits ejects the module with Amanda still inside, forcing her to space-jump back to Sevastopol using a space suit . Amanda returns to the bureau to confront Waits, but before she arrives Sevastopol's service androids begin killing the remaining humans, including Waits. Working with Waits' deputy Ricardo, Amanda links up with Samuels, who sacrifices himself to help her access the control core of Sevastopol's artificial intelligence APOLLO and is destroyed in the process. Amanda also learns from Ricardo that Taylor was secretly sent to retrieve the creature and freed Marlow. At the core, Amanda discovers Weyland-Yutani purchased Sevastopol from Seegson before she arrived at the station, ordering APOLLO to protect the creature at all costs. Amanda informs APOLLO that the creature is no longer onboard, but it responds by stating that ""reactor scans are unverified"". Descending into the reactor, Amanda finds a nest with numerous aliens, and initiates a reactor purge in an attempt to destroy it. However, this inadvertently forces the aliens to leave the nest, and they begin to hunt Amanda again. Ricardo informs Ripley that Marlow has returned to the Anesidora , and she follows him. There, Amanda discovers a personal message from Ellen before being confronted by Marlow, who attempts to overload the ship's reactor to destroy Sevastopol and the aliens. Taylor, who also went to the Anesidora , knocks out Marlow but is too late to stop the overload and both are killed in the subsequent explosion, forcing Amanda to flee the ship before it is destroyed. The explosion damages Sevastopol's orbital stabilizers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Amanda contacts Verlaine for extraction, but a facehugger attacks Ricardo, forcing her to leave him. After helping the Torrens detach from the station, Amanda enters the ship just before Sevastopol is destroyed. However, she finds an alien has boarded the Torrens and killed Verlaine as well; cornered into an airlock, she ejects both herself and it into space. Some time later, a searchlight finds an adrift and unconscious Amanda. Alien: Isolation was developed by Creative Assembly , which is best known for their work on the Total War strategy video game series. A game based on the Alien series from 20th Century Fox was conceived when Creative Assembly finished Viking: Battle for Asgard in 2008, after the publisher, Sega , acquired the rights to develop Alien games in December 2006. A six-person team developed the first prototype to pitch the idea, wherein one player would control the Alien manually while another would conceal themselves in an environment and try to hide from the creature. The game captured the attention of Sega and the project was eventually approved. As Creative Assembly had no experience with survival horror games, it hired people from studios such as Bizarre Creations , Black Rock , Crytek , Ubisoft , and Realtime Worlds . According to the director, Alistair Hope, the team grew from ""a couple of guys crammed in with the Total War team"" to 100 by 2014. Creative Assembly designed the game more in line with Ridley Scott 's 1979 film Alien than James Cameron 's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens . To help them authentically recreate the atmosphere of the film, Fox provided three terabytes of original production material, including costume photography, concept art, set design, photos, videos and sound effects. The artist John Mckellan said, ""It was a proper gold mine. We saw angles of things we'd never seen before."" During the first stage of development, the developers deconstructed the film to find out what made its setting unique. This would allow them to build new environments that were faithful to it. The composers deconstructed the film soundtrack to identify the main cues and extend the soundtrack to fill in the length of the game. The developers also met the Alien and Blade Runner editor Terry Rawlings , who gave them additional insight. Rather than pursue a shiny, high-tech science fiction look, the designers recreated the setting and feel of Alien using the work of the concept artists Ron Cobb and Mœbius . As a result, the game features a lo-fi, 1970s vision of the future, with features ""clunky"" machinery such as phone receivers, monochrome displays and distorted CRT monitors. To create period-authentic distortion on the in-game monitors, the developers recorded their animations onto VHS and Betamax , then filmed those sequences playing on an old portable television while adjusting the tracking settings. As digital hacking had not been conceived in the 1970s, the hacking device was built the way it would have been built on the set of the film, and requires players to tune into a computer's signal while selecting icons on its screen. The team had a rule of not creating anything that the film crew could not have created as a prop in 1979. Creative Assembly wanted Alien: Isolation to have a story that was closely related to the film. They explored a story set 15 years after the film which would involve Ellen Ripley's daughter and the Nostromo ' s flight recorder. The writer Will Porter said creating the backstory for Amanda was ""refreshing"" as he felt that she was an overlooked character. The actress Sigourney Weaver reprised her role as Ellen Ripley to voice small sections because she felt that the story was interesting and true to the film. Along with Weaver, the original Alien cast, which includes Tom Skerritt , Veronica Cartwright , Harry Dean Stanton , and Yaphet Kotto , reprised their roles for the separate downloadable content missions, marking the first time they were reunited since the release of the film. All the characters were created with 3D face scans. The story was rewritten about a year before release; elements of the previous story were discovered in a console build. Alien: Isolation runs on a proprietary engine that was built from scratch by Creative Assembly. Previously used in Viking: Battle for Asgard , the engine was adapted to accommodate technical aspects such as the atmospheric and lighting effects and the Alien's behavioural design. The engine's deferred rendering allowed artists to place ""hundreds"" of dynamic lights in a scene and achieve great geometric detail. A major toolchain update occurred six months into development. Although the new tools eventually improved workflow , they initially caused major disruptions because previous work had to be discarded or ported into the new tools, taking valuable development time away from the team. The Alien was designed to look similar to H. R. Giger 's original design, including the skull underneath its semitransparent head. However, the designers did alter its humanoid legs with recurved ones to provide the Alien a walk cycle that would hold up to scrutiny during longer encounters with the player. Between 70 and 80 different sets of animation for the Alien were created. The Alien's artificial intelligence was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters the player, creating the illusion that the Alien learns from each interaction and appropriately adjusts its hunting strategy. The gameplay designer Gary Napper said, ""We needed something that would be different every time you played it. You're going to die a lot, which means restarting a lot, and if the Alien was scripted, you'd see the same behaviour. That makes the Alien become predictable, and a lot less scary."" The save system was inspired by a scene in the film where Captain Dallas uses a key-card to access Nostromo ' s computer, Mother. The developers originally planned to add a feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, ""We thought about what people would want to do in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger."" Another cancelled feature was the Alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was reportedly implemented at one point, it was removed because the developers felt it would take the game in a ""weird"" direction. Although the game is played from a first-person perspective, it was developed for a considerable amount of time in third-person view. The perspective was changed after the team realised that first person changed the gameplay experience significantly. Hope explained that, in third-person view, Alien: Isolation would have become ""a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move."" Development took four years after Creative Assembly pitched the idea to Sega. Alien: Isolation was released to manufacturing on 9 September 2014. It is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer who died during development. Alien: Isolation was first unveiled on 12 May 2011 when UK government minister Ed Vaizey visited Creative Assembly and revealed on his Twitter account that the studio was hiring for an Alien game. Although no gameplay details were confirmed, Sega confirmed that Isolation would be released for consoles. Sega boss Mike Hayes said it was ""very much a triple-A project. We want this to be a peer to the likes of Dead Space 2 ."" Although the game's name was anticipated following a trademark registration in October 2013 and some screenshots leaked in December 2013, Alien: Isolation was announced and confirmed for PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Windows , Xbox 360 , and Xbox One with the release of a teaser trailer on 7 January 2014. The fact that Sega's previous Alien game, Aliens: Colonial Marines , received a negative public reaction did not affect Creative Assembly. According to Napper, the vocal reaction from the Alien fanbase assured the team that they were building a game the fanbase wanted. Alien: Isolation was presented at E3 2014 , where journalists had a chance to play the game. Polygon described the demo as effective and terrifying. The game was also playable on the Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset that was shown at the show. It was awarded Best VR Game and was nominated for Game of the Show, Best Xbox One Game, Best PlayStation 4 Game, Best PC Game, and Best Action Game at the IGN ' s Best of E3 2014 Awards. At the 2014 Game Critics Awards , it was nominated for Best of Show, Best Console Game, and Best Action/Adventure Game. In August 2014, a cinematic trailer was shown at Gamescom . Alien: Isolation was released on 7 October 2014. Isolation was ported by Feral Interactive to Linux and OS X in late 2015, to Nintendo Switch on 5 December 2019, and to Android and iOS devices on 16 December 2021, and was added to the Amazon Luna service on 14 October 2021. Alien: Isolation supports additional in-game content in the form of downloadable content packs. The first two packs, Crew Expendable and Last Survivor , were made available at the time of release. Crew Expendable , included in the ""Nostromo Edition"", relives a scene from Alien and involves the player controlling Ripley, Dallas or Parker attempting to flush an Alien from the Nostromo ' s air vents into the ship's airlock. Last Survivor , which was originally made available to players who pre-ordered at certain retailers, is set during the film's finale and involves the player controlling Ripley as she tries to activate the Nostromo ' s self-destruct sequence and reach the escape shuttle. Between October 2014 and March 2015, five additional downloadable content packs were released, expanding the Survivor Mode with new features. A season pass to these five Survivor Mode packs could be purchased before they were released. The first pack, Corporate Lockdown , was released on 28 October 2014 and includes three new challenge maps where the player must complete certain objectives. The second pack, Trauma , was released on 2 December 2014 and includes a new character for use in three additional challenge maps. The third pack, Safe Haven , was released on 13 January 2015 and introduces a new character and a new gameplay mode where the player must complete a series of missions under a time limit. The fourth pack, Lost Contact , which was released on 10 February 2015, is similar to Safe Haven , but offers a different playable character and setting. The last pack, The Trigger , was released on 3 March 2015 and includes three additional challenge maps and a new playable character. A collection featuring the base game and all the downloadable content packs was released for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in late 2015. Isolation 's music was produced by English duo The Flight and Christian Henson . Isolation 's sound design was produced by sound designers Byron Bullock and Sam Cooper. Together, music and sound design was nominated for six awards in 2014-2015 and won four of them, namely the ""Audio Achievement"" award at the 11th British Academy Games Awards , for best audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards and the ""Sound Effects"" and ""Use of Sound, Franchise"" at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers awards. In 2024, for the game's 10th anniversary, the soundtrack was officially released on vinyl , cassette and streaming by Hollywood Records . Sega also partnered with the Lofi Girl music label for an ambiance music YouTube video. According to Sega, Isolation had sold more than one million copies worldwide by January 2015. By March, it had sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US, below the expectations of Sega. Critical reception for Alien: Isolation was ""generally favourable"", according to review aggregator Metacritic . Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that Alien: Isolation ""succeeds as a genuine effort to capture the spirit of the film franchise in playable form, rather than a lazy attempt to use it as an easy backdrop for a cash-in with an ill-fitting genre."" Writing for GameSpot , Kevin VanOrd praised the tense and frightening gameplay, stating that ""when all mechanics are working as intended, alien-evasion is dread distilled into its purest, simplest form."" However, he criticised the ""trial and error"" progression and frustrating distances between save points. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer stated similar pros, but criticised the voice acting and dialogue. The visuals and atmosphere were praised. Polygon editor Arthur Gies felt that Alien: Isolation is ""a beautiful game, full of deep shadows and mystery around every corner,"" while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer praised the lighting and unusually compelling environment design. IGN ' s Ryan McCaffrey gave high marks to the retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, writing: ""From wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an area's life-support systems in order to aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like a part of the Alien universe."" Similarly, PC Gamer said that the art design sets Alien: Isolation apart from the likes of System Shock or Dead Space and creates a ""convincing science-fiction world, with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian, rather than overtly futuristic."" The characters were criticised; Game Informer stated that ""Amanda exhibits little growth or personality, other than concern for her fellow humans and a desire not to die gruesomely,"" while Blake Peterson of GameRevolution noted that none of the characters are fully developed. According to him, ""we never spend enough time with them to build the emotional bond necessary for their inevitable deaths to mean anything."" GameTrailers said that most of the computer terminals contain unoriginal logs to describe predictable events, but also remarked that reading reports from different computer terminals ""grounds Sevastopol in an appreciable way."" Writing for GamesRadar , David Houghton praised the Alien's advanced artificial intelligence, stating that ""progress becomes a case of 'if' and 'how', not 'when'. Movement is measured in inches and feet rather than metres, and simply remaining alive becomes more exhilarating than any objective achieved."" Peterson praised the gameplay as tense, scary and effective, writing that Alien: Isolation is ""a solid, incredibly striking example of the [survival horror] genre that uses its first person perspective to greater personalize the horror"". PC Gamer credited the crafting system for creating ""a lot of unexpected depth"", allowing players to outsmart enemies in multiple ways. The Survivor Mode was praised by Chris Carter of Destructoid , who felt it offered players different feelings and experiences each time they played it. Although the gameplay was praised by several reviewers, some found Isolation unnecessarily long, repetitive, and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that it did not offer many options of survival, requiring players to spend most of their time hiding in lockers ""staring at the motion tracker"". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the Alien, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, ""Every time I thought I heard the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed."" Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered ""brave"" by IGN due to its difficult gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. Alien: Isolation received year-end awards including PC Gamer ' s Game of the Year 2014, Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards , Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards , and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. It was named the best game of 2014 by The Daily Telegraph , second-best by Empire and Time , and fourth by The Guardian . The Daily Mirror named it one of the 10 best games of 2014, and Eurogamer readers voted it the third-best. In 2015, Kotaku named Alien: Isolation the sixth-best horror game, and in 2018 The A.V. Club ranked it the fifth-best and GamesRadar+ ranked it the third-best. GamesRadar , Game Informer , GamesTM , Gaming Bolt , Sports Illustrated and USA Today named Alien Isolation one of the best video games ever made . In 2014, Napper said the team often discussed ideas for a sequel. The Creative Assembly head, Tim Heaton, said in 2015 they were proud of Isolation and that a sequel was ""not out of the question"" but financially unfeasible. In 2017, Eurogamer reported that no sequel was in development and that most of the Isolation design team had left Creative Assembly. On 7 October 2024, the 10th anniversary of the game's release, Creative Assembly announced that a sequel was in early development. Two comic book sequels, Aliens: Resistance and Aliens: Rescue , were released in 2019. A spin-off developed by D3 Go, Alien: Blackout , was released for mobile devices on 24 January 2019. It was shut down on 31 October 2023. In 2016, a pinball video game adaptation, Aliens vs. Pinball , was released for the Zen Pinball 2 and Pinball FX 2 video games developed by Zen Studios . A novelisation by Keith DeCandido , and a streaming television series adaptation by Jeff Juhasz and Fabien Dubois, were released in 2019. Alien: Romulus (2024) includes several elements from the game. In the expansion pack Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty (2023), the mission titled Somewhat Damaged draws inspiration from Isolation .",Creative Assembly,"7 October 2014 PS3 , PS4 , Win , X360 , XOne 7 October 2014 Linux 29 September 2015 OS X 28 October 2015 Nintendo Switch 5 December 2019 Android , iOS 16 December 2021",PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4 Windows Xbox 360 Xbox One Linux OS X Nintendo Switch Android iOS,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,birth; daughter; mother,wife,trauma,,escape; imprisoned; prison,kill; killed,,creature; monster; witch,girl; teen,
American McGee's Alice,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee%27s_Alice," American McGee's Alice is a 2000 third-person dark fantasy action-adventure video game developed by Rogue Entertainment under the direction of designer American McGee and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Games banner. The game was originally released for Windows and Mac OS . Although a planned PlayStation 2 port was cancelled, the game was later released digitally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via downloadable content for its sequel . The game's premise is based on the Lewis Carroll novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871) but presents a gloomy, cruel and violent version of the setting. The game centers on the novels' protagonist Alice , whose family is killed in a house fire years before the story of the game takes place. After several years of treatment in a psychiatric clinic, the emotionally traumatized Alice makes a mental retreat to Wonderland , which has been disfigured by her injured psyche. American McGee's Alice uses the id Tech 3 game engine, which was previously used in Quake III Arena and redesigned for this game by Ritual Entertainment . The game was met with positive critical reception, with reviewers commending the high artistic and technical quality of the level design while criticizing the excessive linearity of the gameplay. As of September 2017, American McGee's Alice has sold over 1.5 million copies. A sequel, Alice: Madness Returns , was released in 2011. American McGee's Alice is a third-person action game in which the player controls the titular character Alice along a linear route. Alice can communicate with non-player characters , fight off enemies and bosses , and solve puzzles . Along with the basic actions of walking and jogging, Alice can jump, cling to ledges, climb and swing on ropes, swim in water, and glide over columns of steam by using her inflated dress as a makeshift parachute. The game can be played at four difficulty levels: ""Easy"", Medium"", ""Hard"" and ""Nightmare"". The game's levels feature many platforms and other obstacles not based on artificial intelligence as well as puzzles that require solving for further passage through the game. Throughout the game, Alice can obtain up to ten different weapons, known as ""toys"", for use against enemies. Most toys have two modes of use, which differ in the method and strength of the attack. The first toy acquired by Alice is the Vorpal Blade, which, along with the Croquet Mallet, can be used for basic melee attacks. Toys with longer range include the Ice Wand and an explosive jack-in-the-box. One particular toy, the Jabberwock's Eye Staff, is essential to the narrative and is assembled from pieces scattered throughout the setting. The game's combat system implements automatic target designation: if an enemy character is nearby, the player's weapon sight is automatically fixed upon that enemy. Outside of combat, the sight plays the role of a jump indicator by taking on the shape of two footprints that appear on the surface of any place that Alice would land if she made a jump. Because the game takes place within Alice's imagination, the health mechanic is represented as ""sanity"", which is displayed as a red bar on the left-hand side of the screen. The sanity meter decreases when Alice sustains damage from enemy attacks or an environmental hazard. When the sanity meter is depleted, the game prematurely ends , after which it can be continued from where the game was last saved . A magic mechanic is represented as ""willpower"", and it is displayed as a blue bar on the right-hand side of the screen. Willpower is consumed when almost any toy is used, and a toy will not serve its function when Alice's willpower is too low. Certain amounts of sanity or willpower can be restored by collecting crystals of ""meta-essence"", the life force of Wonderland. Crystals of ""meta-substance"", representing the power of imagination, restore sanity and willpower simultaneously. All crystal types can be found scattered across levels and some respawn within certain places. Meta-substance can be obtained after defeating an enemy; the volume of the meta-substance is dependent on the strength of the defeated enemy. Certain uncommon items can be found throughout the game that enhance Alice's abilities: ""Ragebox Elixir"" increases the damage dealt by Alice with the Vorpal Blade, the ""Darkened Looking Glass"" makes Alice invisible to enemies, and ""Grasshopper Tea"" augments Alice's speed and jumping height. These items change Alice's appearance and their effects are limited to a short period of time, after which Alice returns to her original state. In 1863, Alice Liddell is awoken from a dream of Wonderland by a house fire. Although she is able to save herself, her parents are killed and she is left with serious burns and psychological damage. Alice is brought to Rutledge Asylum in a state of catatonia , where several years of treatment fail to rouse her from her stupor. When Alice's toy rabbit seems to call to her for help, she mentally retreats to Wonderland, which appears to have been disfigured by her broken mind. Alice meets the Cheshire Cat , who invites her to follow the White Rabbit . She learns from nearby village inhabitants that the Queen of Hearts has put Wonderland in decline and despondency, and that the White Rabbit has promised a champion in Alice. Alice is directed to an old gnome who can aid her pursuit of the White Rabbit by reducing her size. The gnome and Alice infiltrate the Fortress of Doors and enter the school inside, where they create an elixir that shrinks Alice and allows her passage to the Vale of Tears. After aiding the Mock Turtle in retrieving his stolen shell from the Duchess , Alice catches up to the White Rabbit, who takes her in the direction of the Caterpillar before he is crushed by the normal-sized Hatter 's foot. Alice meets with the Caterpillar, who explains to her that Wonderland's current form is the result of Alice's survivor guilt and advises her to slay the Queen of Hearts to restore Wonderland's integrity. Alice returns to normal size after nibbling from a mushroom guarded by the Voracious Centipede. In the center of a plateau , Alice discovers a piece of the Jabberwock's Eye Staff. The voice of an unseen oracle tells Alice that before the Queen of Hearts can be slain, Alice must first eliminate the Queen's sentinel – the Jabberwock , who she must kill to obtain the final piece of the Eye Staff. In her search for the remaining pieces of the Eye Staff, Alice defeats the Red King in the chess-themed Looking-Glass Land, as well as the Hatter's minions Tweedledum and Tweedledee . Alice later finds that the Hatter is conducting cruel experiments on the March Hare and Dormouse , and he is keeping the Gryphon captive. After killing the Hatter, Alice frees the Gryphon, who offers to rally forces against the Queen of Hearts and takes Alice to the Land of Fire and Brimstone, the abode of the Jabberwock. Within the remains of Alice's old home, the Jabberwock wracks Alice with guilt over her parents' deaths and overpowers her in a fight until the Gryphon returns and rescues Alice by depriving the Jabberwock of one of his eyes. With the Jabberwock's Eye Staff fully assembled, the Gryphon directs Alice to Queensland and takes off with the intention of stopping the Jabberwock himself. On her way to the Queen of Hearts's castle, Alice sees the Gryphon and the Jabberwock engaged in an aerial battle, which ends with the Gryphon mortally wounded. Following Alice's victory against the Jabberwock, the dying Gryphon entrusts Alice with the final battle against the Queen of Hearts. At the entrance to the Queen's Hall, the Cheshire Cat attempts to confess to Alice about the nature of the Queen of Hearts, but he is suddenly executed as he states that ""You are two parts of the same..."" Alice engages in a fight with a figure puppeteered by the real Queen of Hearts, a giant fleshy tentacled creature who warns Alice that destroying her will destroy them both. Upon Alice's final victory over the Queen of Hearts, Wonderland is restored, and many of the characters who had died in the journey are revived. Her mind repaired, Alice leaves Rutledge Asylum. After leaving id Software in 1997, creative director American McGee was inspired to design a game that did not involve space marines, guns, aliens and outer space, which were the common themes in the Doom and Quake series. McGee's dark and lustrous image of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was primarily inspired by the Crystal Method track ""Trip Like I Do"" , in which he heard the word ""wonder"". Following this inspiration, McGee and his creative partner R.J. Berg began sketching a narrative and preliminary designs. McGee's goal was to present what he considered to be a natural extension of the setting and characters of the original Alice novels. Many of the early experiments with evolving the material of the novel – which included manga , futuristic, cartoon and sexual interpretations – strayed from McGee's intended direction. Sketches of Alice, the Cheshire Cat and the Hatter by Terry Smith and Norm Felchle played a decisive role in establishing the game's visual style and served as a foundation for subsequent concept art. McGee sought to omit shortcomings in products that he had previously designed, such as recreating reality instead of creating a fantastic world, reusing traditional weapons, and unremarkable characters. The game had a budget of $4.5 million. While working on the game's plot, McGee considered several approaches to Alice's return to Wonderland, one of which involved a modern-day Alice murdering her abusive stepfather in reality while journeying through Wonderland, which was rejected by EA. Another approach involved the projection of Alice's parents and acquaintances onto the characters of Wonderland and Alice investigating the cause of her father's death. After discarding this concept as too complicated, McGee ultimately aimed for ""the simplest story that told the most"". Aside from the reappearance of characters and locations mentioned in the novels, no references to the novels' plots are made in the game, as McGee did not intend for the game to be a continuation or competing version of Carroll's work. The development team solely used the original novels as reference material, ignoring film adaptations and other derivative works. The game's title, which includes McGee's name, was chosen at EA's insistence, primarily for the ease of registering and protecting a new trademark . McGee admitted that he did not support the title, as he opined that it put the rest of the development team in the background. American McGee's Alice is McGee's debut work as a lead game designer. EA licensed Ritual Entertainment 's Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.² engine, which is in turn a modified Quake III Arena engine . The most notable changes in the engine include the use of the Tiki model system, which enables the engine to use skeletal animation among other things, the Babble dialog system which enables lip synching of audio with character animations, dynamic music system, scriptable camera, particle system and extended shader support. The changes implemented to the engine for Alice remained minimal however. The game's .bsp files even retain F.A.K.K.² ' s headers, albeit sporting a different version number. An early version of the game featured the ability to summon the Cheshire Cat to aid the player in battle. Though this feature was removed from the final product, beta screenshots of this version do exist online. In the final product, the player can press a button to summon the Cheshire Cat at any time, though he merely provides cryptic advice on the current situation and does nothing to aid Alice if she is being attacked. An Alice port for the then-unreleased PlayStation 2 was also in development but was later cancelled, which caused Rogue Entertainment to shut down, another decision which angered American McGee and resulted him leaving EA in frustration. The game's box art was altered after release to show Alice holding the Ice Wand instead of the Vorpal Blade and to reduce the skeletal character of the Cheshire Cat's anatomy. EA cited complaints from various consumer groups as its reason for altering the original art, though McGee stated the alteration was made due to internal concerns at EA. Alice was EA's first M-rated game, a rating which McGee fought to obtain, because he did not want an Alice product to be sold at Christmas time, since parents could be confused, thinking that the game was intended to be a gift for children. However, in a 2009 interview, McGee expressed regret for his decision and said that the violence in the game did not warrant an M-rating; he felt that consumers should buy products responsibly after referring to the recommendations of the ESRB . The game's music was composed and recorded by Chris Vrenna , and was released as a soundtrack by Six Degrees Records . The album was released on CD on October 16, 2001, and on digital platforms on April 24, 2007. The style of the soundtrack is dominated by ambient and experimental electronica . In addition to composing the music, Vrenna mixed, produced and arranged the album. He spent several months on eBay , where he purchased mechanical toys, a xylophone , a cuckoo clock and tubular bells in order to record sound samples for the tracks. The soundtrack features toy instruments, percussion, music box sounds, ticking clocks, creaking doors, female voices, maniacal laughter, screaming, crying, and baby talk. Mark Blasquez wrote the lyrics, Peter Reardon remixed the track ""Flying On The Wings Of Steam (Remix)"", and Jeff Antebi managed it. The recording featured singer Jessicka . Marilyn Manson was originally involved scoring the music for the game. His composition has been described by American McGee as ""very cool"" and having ""a very beautiful Beatles -in-their- harpsichord -and- Hookah -pipe-days-sound to it."" Manson's contributions persisted into the final product, notably the influence of alchemy and the character of the Mad Hatter whose adaptation was somewhat influenced by him; for a time Manson was considered for the voice of the Hatter. In 2000, prior to the games' release, McGee hosted the US national Alice Wicked Wonderland Tour with electronic musician Green Velvet . At these shows, footage of the game would be released and would be promoted as a multimedia event. Eventually photos from the San Francisco shows on the tour would be available on the official Alice site. A strategy guide by Prima Games was published in 2000. By January 2002, along with the game's film adaptation, a comic book series and a toy line dedicated to the game were in development. In 2004, EA and Atari released a collaboration 7"" clear blue vinyl American McGee's Alice LP of two sides, Side A: 'Wonderland Woods ( Tweaker Remix)' and Side B: 'Take the Pill' from Enter the Matrix composed, produced and remixed by Chris Vrenna. These LPs were limited to 500 copies and signed by McGee and Vrenna and distributed by Waxploitation Records . In 2006, Muckle Mannequins created life-sized statues of Alice and the Cheshire Cat on stands with variants for video game stores for international promotion. Costume ware was released under McGee's company Mysterious . Milo's Workshop completed four editions of releases from 2000 to 2009 of official figurines with rare editions of variants of several Alice characters. In 2010, Epic Weapons created a life-size replica of the Vorpal Blade to commemorate the game's tenth anniversary. The blade was made from stainless steel with patterns engraved on the blade and handle. The company created 1,000 copies of the blade, with the first 25 being sold in an auction held from July 22 to July 31, 2010. In 2011, for Alice: Madness Returns , there was a new Vorpal blade, in which the two were sold as a packaged deal. In the United States, American McGee's Alice sold 360,000 units by August 2006. As of September 2017, the game has sold 1.5 million copies. At the time, this led Edge to declare it the country's 47th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000. The game was ultimately released on December 5, 2000, receiving praise for its visuals; the graphics were very elaborate for their time. Many levels depict a world of chaos and wonder, some reminiscent of the inside of an asylum or a madhouse, visually linking Wonderland to Alice's reality. The exterior views of Wonderland show the Queen of Hearts' tentacles dipping out of buildings and mountain sides, especially in Queensland. Alice received ""favorable"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . GameSpot said, ""While you'll undoubtedly enjoy the imaginative artwork, you might end up disappointed with just how straightforward the underlying game really is."" In her article ""Wonderland's become quite strange: From Lewis Carroll's Alice to American McGee's Alice "", literary critic Cathlena Martin argues that the game ""provides a reinterpreted version of Alice and the whole of wonderland that may have some players questioning which aspects are from Carroll and which are from McGee, thus potentially leading to a rereading of Carroll through the darker lens of McGee's Alice. This reinterpretation of Alice shows the versatility and mutability of the story across time and discourse."" Martin also notes that the game is successful largely in part to the narrative structure of Carroll's tales, which are built around games - cards and chess - themselves. Blake Fischer reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation , rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "" Alice is an incredibly beautiful and well-designed shooter. If you're looking for more, you may pass, but otherwise it's a game you won't want to miss."" A film adaptation of American McGee's Alice was planned prior to the game's release. Scott Faye, a spokesman for Dimension Films and an old acquaintance of McGee, visited EA to negotiate an adaptation of an EA product. Faye and other Dimension Films representatives were shown gameplay footage of Alice and were impressed by its visuals. Later, Miramax head Bob Weinstein was shown the game's trailer, after which he immediately (and without waiting for the opinion of the board of directors) supported the production of a film adaptation. On July 5, 2000, FGN Online published an exclusive piece claiming that EA had signed an agreement with Miramax to create a film based on the game. According to the publisher's source, American McGee would be involved in the film's production, potentially as a creative director or co-producer. On December 7, 2000, McGee formally announced the film adaptation, which had been entrusted with Collision Entertainment, a subsidiary of Dimension Films, after ten months of negotiations. Wes Craven and John August were attached as director and screenwriter, with McGee co-producing the film alongside Collision Entertainment, and Abandon Entertainment acting as international distributor. No actors had yet been signed on, but Natalie Portman was rumored to have expressed interest. Milla Jovovich and Christina Ricci were also rumored to be attached. In September 2001, August explained that he had turned in a script treatment for Alice and was not attached to develop fuller drafts for the film adaptation. In December 2001, Craven announced that the film would be a computer-animated feature with a tentative 2003 release date. In February 2002, Dimension Films signed brother screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber to write a new screenplay for Alice . In July 2003, the brothers announced that they had completed the script for the film adaptation. On March 4, 2004, McGee reported that the project had moved from Dimension Films to 20th Century Fox . On June 21, 2005, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Universal Pictures had acquired the film and signed Sarah Michelle Gellar on for the lead role, with Marcus Nispel attached to direct and the Hoeber brothers still attached to write. On February 8, 2006, Scott Faye, who had become a producer of the project, announced that filming would begin in the summer of 2006, with a budget of $40 to $50 million and a tentative 2007 release date. By 2008, the project was in turnaround , and Nispel and Gellar's involvement had ceased. Rumors circulated of Jane March being cast as the Queen of Hearts, which Faye denied. In July 2013, American McGee announced that he had reached an agreement with Collision Entertainment, which still owned the Alice film rights. The company stated its readiness to transfer these rights to McGee, but demanded $500,000 for them. McGee decided to raise this amount from crowdfunding via Kickstarter . By this time, funds were already being raised via Kickstarter for Spicy Horse 's OZombie project; according to McGee, any surplus funds would be set aside for film production. With an additional $100,000 raised, Spicy Horse would be able to create short animated films, and if the initially required amount is exceeded by $500,000, the studio would receive the rights to create a full-length feature film. On July 14, the Kickstarter campaign for OZombie was closed due to insufficient funds, with McGee shifting his focus toward securing the Alice film rights. With the success of earning the funds to produce Alice: Otherlands , McGee stated his desire to continue to work on the possibility of adapting the series into a feature film on Kickstarter. On February 17, 2014, McGee announced that he and his team have secured a British screenwriter to write the film's script. On April 16, 2014, he assured fans that the film is still in production and is currently working with a producer in Hollywood who they have licensed the rights from, but has run into a few difficulties along the way. On July 10, 2014, McGee informed fans that the progress on the feature film has come to a temporary halt. McGee stated that he had secured the rights only to develop the feature film's story and production and needed to acquire the film rights completely before proceeding further. He was speaking with potential investors and financiers to gather the $400,000 (~$515,742 in 2024) required but on January 8, 2015, McGee stated that negotiations for the feature film had gone on a hiatus. On January 31, 2022, it was announced that Radar Pictures – in partnership with Abandon Entertainment – was developing a television adaptation of American McGee's Alice written and co-produced by David Hayter . No broadcaster or streaming platform has yet acquired the series. In 2025, American McGee revealed on Reddit that the series was ""dead"" due to a failed pitch meeting, citing its concept involving time travel and a modern-day setting as the reason it failed. As the plans for the movie adaptation of American McGee's Alice started to take longer and longer, in 2007 interest at Electronic Arts rose in a remake of the game and work was started on a sequel. On February 19, 2009, EA CEO John Riccitiello announced at D.I.C.E. 2009 that a new installment to the series is in the works for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and PC. It was developed by Spicy Horse , who worked on American McGee's Grimm . Two pieces of concept art were released, depicting Alice and large allied birds fighting an oversized, semi-mechanized snail and its children on top of a lighthouse, and Alice swimming in a pond, with the Cheshire Cat's face in the background. In November 2009, a fan-made video based on the Alice 2 announcement was mistaken by gaming websites as a teaser trailer for the game. In it, Alice is in therapy after a relapse nine months after the events of the first game, and she appears to hallucinate an image of the Cheshire Cat in place of her doctor. On June 15, 2010, EA filed a trademark on the name Alice: Madness Returns , the suspected sequel to American McGee's Alice . While the sequel was formally announced via press release on February 19, 2009, the sequel's title was confirmed during the EA Studio Showcase the following day. The game was released on June 14, 2011, in North America, June 16, 2011, in Europe, June 17, 2011, in the United Kingdom and July 21, 2011, in Japan under the title Alice: Madness Returns for PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions came with a redemption code that gave the player a free download of American McGee's Alice . This version is available through backward compatibility on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S , and is part of the EA Play service on these platforms.

Amy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_%28video_game%29," Amy is a survival horror stealth video game, released in 2012, developed by VectorCell and published by Lexis Numérique. Amy depicts the journey of Amy, an autistic child with supernatural powers, and her protector Lana. In a city suffering from a zombie -type infection which Amy is immune to (and can heal Lana from), Lana must stay near her young charge, for frequent healing, while protecting her from the infected, and the Phoenix Foundation who hopes to exploit her. Amy received negative critical reviews, due to its technical issues, controls, voice-acting, and game design, although a few felt it offered some unique gameplay ideas. The player controls Lana, the woman escorting Amy and protecting her as the two attempt to escape their disease-ridden town. They encounter monsters and the military, among other foes, in their attempt to escape. The player is forced to protect Amy from the zombies, often making her hide, to avoid detection. However, Lana starts succumbing to the plague without medicine, and thus must remain close to Amy, to return for healing. There are syringes infrequently, which allow Lana to heal without returning to Amy. However, when Lana is somewhat infected, she can safely walk past zombies, which necessitates a balance between healing and zombification. At certain times, Lana must rely on Amy for other abilities: Amy can use shockwaves, to push enemies and objects, causing distractions, as well as a sound bubble, muffling glass either being smashed or stepped on, defending Lana. Amy also hacks computers and climbs through vents when Lana needs her to. The player must escort Amy, an autistic 8-year-old as they try to get her out of a city overrun with wild creatures and enemies. Lana ( Sabine Crossen ) and Amy are traveling to a doctor in Silver City via train, when an explosion derails the train, and their plans. They discover that the people have been turned to monsters via a strange infection, and must escape the monsters, as they continue their journey to the city. They must also fend off the Phoenix Foundation, an organisation who intends to control Amy and exploit her strange powers. On 3 April 2012, VectorCell announced a patch for Amy on the game's official Facebook page. The patch was released on 6 April. Major changes include the saving of the player's progress during chapters, the addition of more checkpoints, skipping of sequences in-game and several corrections to the subtitles. Amy received ""generally unfavorable reviews"" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . IGN 's Colin Moriarty stated at the end of his review that he ""spent at least a dozen hours with [ Amy ], got as far as the end portion of the fifth chapter, and gave up out of sheer anger and frustration."" Game Informer ' s Jeff Cork stated that ""as a downloadable title, I wasn't expecting [ Amy ] to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However, I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether [ Amy ] is delivered to you via download, retail SKU, direct brain wave, or retinal implant, it is terrible and should be avoided."" James Stephanie Sterling of Destructoid went as far in their review as to describe Amy as ""one of the worst games ever made"". Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of The Escapist criticized the game's awkward camera views, poor optimization to Xbox, and also gave up the game in frustration due to the addition of poorly implemented stealth mechanics, and later stated that it was the worst game of 2012 and the second worst game of the entire 2010s behind Hunt Down the Freeman . The most positive PlayStation 3 review was given by Thomas Pichler from GamingXP . He praised the main protagonist, but criticized the periodical lack of explanation of what to do next. Alan Bradley of GamesRadar+ said Amy was boring and no fun to play and really unpleasant for most of the time. He also criticised the combination of a bad control system and widely spaced checkpoints that meant the player would have to repeat sections numerous times. 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 3.3 out of 10 and said that it ""tries to offer something new. The good news is that it does introduce some new gameplay concepts that can be toyed with by developers. The bad news, the controls and gameplay are implemented in such a way the game will just leave you frustrated and angry."" Susan Arendt of The Escapist gave the same console version one-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, ""Pick something to hate about videogames, and Amy has it. Graphics glitches, lousy design, repetitious gameplay, mushy controls, bad acting, horrible save system ... it's all there. The game's few good ideas simply aren't enough to suffer through the amount of crap surrounding them."" The A.V. Club gave the same console version a D, saying, ""Oddly, it is tempting to look forward to a second outing, however unlikely. Because videogame disasters this gruesome are fascinating. And, to be dangerously optimistic, Amy can't get much worse."" Metro UK gave the same console version one out of ten, saying, ""Awful in almost every possible aspect, this hugely disappointing download is not just a failure as a survival horror but as a video game."" The Digital Fix gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of one out of ten, saying, ""If you need to satiate your survival-horror appetite go revisit the Resident Evil series, Clock Tower or Parasite Eve as you will get much more interesting and developed games despite them being released over a decade ago."" It was included among the worst games of all time by GamesRadar+ in 2014 and in 2017.",VectorCell,WW : 11 January 2012,Xbox 360 [ 1 ] PlayStation 3 [ 2 ],False,False,False,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,,,,infected,escape; must escape,,forced,creature; evil; monster,young,
Anchorhead,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorhead," Anchorhead is a Lovecraftian horror interactive fiction game , originally written and published by Michael S. Gentry in 1998. The game is heavily inspired by the works and writing style of H.P. Lovecraft , particularly the Cthulhu mythos . Anchorhead takes place in a fictional New England town of the same name, where the unnamed protagonist and her husband, a professor and aspiring writer, have relocated to in order to take possession of his ancestral family home. Through historical investigation of the town and her husband's family, the protagonist uncovers a conspiracy to perform a ritual that will summon a Great Old One and put the planet in jeopardy. The protagonist must stop the ritual from occurring and save her husband.  The game story takes place across three days, with the first two corresponding to whole days and the third day divided into a number of segments. There is no time limit in the first two days; each day ends when the player has completed a required task or tasks. Only during the third day does the game impose constraints on the number of turns a player can take to solve the necessary puzzles. Anchorhead was hailed by critics and players as one of the best interactive fiction games available due to its complex and intricate backstory and well-written dialogue and descriptions. In the 1998 XYZZY Awards , Anchorhead received the award for Best Setting , and was also nominated for Best Game . The game is played through the perspective of an unnamed woman whose husband, Michael, suddenly inherits a large mansion in Anchorhead, Massachusetts, from family that he wasn't aware existed. The previous owner, Edward Verlac, killed his wife and daughter before taking his own life under mysterious circumstances. The game itself is split into 4 ""days"", each of which contains a set of puzzles that are required before the advancement of the next. On arriving in town, the car breaks under strange circumstances, stranding them in town without contact with the outside world. Croesus Verlac, the family's founder, has been possessing many of his male heirs in sequence, and begins to possess Michael. Croesus is attempting to summon a Great Old One named Ialdabaoloth, who takes the corporeal form of a multi-tentacled comet and is heading towards Earth at alarming rate. The protagonist sabotages Croesus' machine to summon Ialdabaoloth, saving the world. An epilogue shows that the protagonist is pregnant, raising concern that Croesus may attempt to possess her child if it is a son. Anchorhead was written by Michael Gentry, who was living in Austin, Texas , in the Inform 6 programming language . Development took approximately a year, with several weeks dedicated to designing the game map and writing the story, ""at least six solid hours of coding every day,"" and an additional three months dedicated to debugging . Gentry based the two main characters on himself and his wife. The game heavily draws elements from Lovecraftian literature, specifically The Dunwich Horror , The Music of Erich Zann , and The Festival , as well as direct references, such as the Miskatonic River and the city of Arkham . In 2006, Gentry announced a rewrite of Anchorhead in Inform 7 preliminarily titled Anchorhead: the Director's Cut Special Edition, where the main goal is to ""be just as evocative as the original, while allowing more room for the reader's imagination."" Gentry also stated that some technological limitations encountered in Inform 6 would be addressed and NPC characters would be more interactive, thanks to the language's relatively easy declaration of relationships between the game objects. Gentry released the source code for the first five rooms in this edition on May 17, and a playable demo was released on December 15. The rewrite was released in 2018 as Anchorhead: the Illustrated Edition . This version features revised and polished prose, redesigned puzzles, and new puzzles and backstory, along with 51 black and white illustrations by Carlos Cara Àlvarez . Unlike previous versions, the Illustrated Edition is a commercial release, available for purchase only. Anchorhead has received critical acclaim. Praise for the game was often directed towards its attention to detail in its descriptions, which built an imaginative and convincing game world; though some criticism was directed towards its puzzles in the later half of the game, which for some meant resorting to a walkthrough . Gregory W. Kulczycki stated that the game was ""the most intelligent, polished and captivating piece of interactive fiction I have played to date."" Kulczycki praised the ""excellent"" writing, which had a ""refreshing attention to detail,"" feeling that playing Anchorhead was ""like reading a good book;"" and the puzzles, although not particularly difficult, helped ""build a richer environment for the player."" However, Kulczycki felt that the frequent game saves due to easy death in the last chapter began to ""distract from the natural flow of the story."" Emily Short called Anchorhead a ""deeply beautiful piece,"" stating that the game had a ""masterful build-up of setting and mood unparalleled by almost every other game I have ever played,"" particularly focusing on the scenery descriptions that made the environment ""oppressively real."" Short described the structure of the game play as ""natural and immersive,"" feeling that none of the puzzles during the first half of the game were tacked on or redundant, though she ""would have preferred a trifle less emphasis on timed puzzles in the later part of the game."" Terrence Bosky also called Anchorhead ""a well-written, wonderfully designed adventure game,"" stating that it ""works brilliantly as a Lovecraft pastiche , never entering the realm of parody ."" Bosky however disliked the over-dependence on nearly all the items , expressing that ""it would have been nice not having to lug everything around."" In the 1998 XYZZY Awards , the game won Best Setting and was a finalist for five other awards, including Best Game . It is (2023) listed as the #2 game in the Interactive Fiction Database Top 100.",Michael S.

Araya,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araya_%28video_game%29,"ARAYA is a 2016 first person horror-themed adventure game , developed by MAD Virtual Reality Studio for Microsoft Windows . The story is told from the perspective of 3 different characters: Marisa , Araya's best friend who enters the hospital after receiving a mysterious text from Araya; Rama , the hospital's security guard, and Boon who enters the hospital to fulfill a gambling debt. The story's perspective shifts between the three characters as players explore different areas of a derelict Bangkok hospital, in order to piece together the mysterious circumstances and solve the murder case of Araya. Araya was a bipolar and misanthropic young woman who found friendship and comfort with Marisa. Despite Marisa's warning against it, Araya enters a relationship with a playboy named Sorn. The relationship results in an unwanted pregnancy and causes conflict between the couple. For an unknown reason, Sorn procures a ""sleeping"" pill and gives it to Araya; the pill turns out to be lethal and kills Araya. Not wanting to be blamed for her death, Sorn takes Araya's body to the hospital's parking garage, where he hangs her by a noose and later dies by accident. A year after Araya's death, Marisa gets a text from her and goes to the now-desolate hospital to investigate. During her exploration, Marisa is chased by a man named Jit, who previously worked there and now stays for an unknown reason, and is knocked unconscious by him. Rama wakes up after having fallen asleep in the guardhouse and patrols the hospital grounds. Rama spots Jit, who he previously knew, and the unconscious Marisa, and is chased by Jit. Rama later calls for help and meets up with his boss at a different area within the hospital. However, Rama's boss is ambushed and seemingly killed by Jit. Jit chases Rama again, but is knocked out by a falling shelf. Boon, enters the hospital to complete a task for a gang in order to fulfill his gambling debt. He is encounters the hospital's many ghosts, including a gigantic ""Preta,"" a spirit believed to be children that have sinned against their parents and are punished after death. Later, Boon finally crosses paths with Rama, who tells him to escape while he goes to help Marisa. After reawakening, Marisa explores the hospital once again, following Araya's spirit. She is once again chased by Jit and falls down an elevator shaft, but is unharmed. Marisa enters a room that has been turned into a ritual chamber where she finds the corpse of Araya, causing her to faint. She wakes up and walks through a nightmarish labyrinth. Towards the end of the maze she hears Sorn and Araya's argument over her pregnancy. Marisa then finds Araya's spirit hanging in the spot where Sorn had left her, whereupon Araya transforms into a vengeful ghost, believing that there is no one left who truly cares for her. Rama arrives at the ritual chamber and sees Marisa and Araya's corpse. Rama examines Araya's corpse and removes the ritual nail from her forehead, freeing her spirit. After trying to awake Marisa, Jit enters the room and attacks him. Rama overpowers him and the player is given the option to either kill or spare Jit. Rama's boss reappears and knocks him out, blaming Rama for ruining their plan, which involved he and Jit using Araya's spirit for financial gain. Araya's ghost appears behind Rama's boss and attacks him, causing him to knock over an altar of candles, causing a fire that rapidly engulfs the hospital. Marisa wakes up and runs for the exit, avoiding the fire and Araya. At the exit, the ghost blocks her path. Two endings can occur depending on whether or not Jit was spared. If spared, Jit arrives and stabs the spirit with his sacred dagger. If Jit is killed, it is Rama who attacks Araya instead. Either way, all three main characters escape the now burning hospital. Marisa wakes up outside the hospital, under care of the police that have arrived on the scene. Rama stares at the burning building, and Boon frantically explains what happened to a policeman. If Jit is spared, he is seen sitting on the ground outside holding his head in his hands. As Marisa looks up at the blaze, an unknown person reaches for her hand.",MAD Virtual Reality Studio,"WW : November 24, 2016",Windows,True,False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,pregnancy,,bipolar,body,escape,kill; killed; murder,,,young,
BloodRayne,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloodRayne_%28video_game%29," BloodRayne is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Terminal Reality and released on October 31, 2002. The game has since spawned a franchise with the addition of sequels, films , and self-contained comic books . A remastered version was released on November 20, 2020 as BloodRayne: Terminal Cut by Terminal Reality and Ziggurat Interactive, and later on PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch as BloodRayne: ReVamped on November 18, 2021. In 1933, while searching for her vampire father, dhampir Rayne is recruited by the Brimstone Society, a secret society that monitors and combats supernatural threats to humanity. For her first mission, Rayne is deployed to the town of Mortton, Louisiana , to investigate reports of a plague that is transforming local residents into zombie -like mutants. She is accompanied by Mynce, her mentor and fellow dhampir. In Mortton, Rayne finds the town infested by spider-like monsters called Maraisreq, one of which devours and apparently kills Mynce. After killing the ""queen"" Maraisreq, Rayne finds a strange glowing rib in its corpse; when she touches it, the rib immediately implants itself into her own torso. Before she can recover from the shock, Rayne is attacked by a man in a Nazi uniform who forcibly removes the rib from her body and leaves her for dead, although she survives. Five years later, in 1938, Brimstone sends Rayne to Argentina to perform reconnaissance at a mining facility where the Nazis are rumored to be searching for a mystical relic of great power. Brimstone provides Rayne with a target list of high-ranking Nazi officers to assassinate , one of whom she recognizes as the man who attacked her in Louisiana: Jürgen Wulf, leader of the Gegengeist Gruppe (G.G.G.; literally ""Anti-Ghost Group""), the Nazi counterparts of Brimstone who seek to harness occult powers for the Third Reich . A Thule Society high priest tells Rayne that the Nazis are searching the mine for the skull of Beliar , a legendary king of Atlantis , whom the Nazis revere as the pinnacle of Aryan superiority. As Rayne descends into the mine, she discovers that the facility has been overrun by ""Daemites,"" demonic parasites that take humans as hosts and serve to guard Beliar's skull. Deep within the mine, Rayne locates the crystal skull containing Beliar's eye, the true relic, which implants itself into her head, enhancing her vision. One of Rayne's targets, the cyborg Mauler, informs her that Beliar was not an Atlantean king at all, but was in fact the original devil . Beliar was overthrown by Mephisto , who dismembered him and scattered his body parts across the world. The rib from the queen Maraisreq is one of these parts, as is the eye from the mine, but the most powerful relic is Beliar's heart, which can summon the demon himself. Mauler boasts that the heart is buried beneath Castle Gaustadt in Germany , where Wulf will soon excavate it. The Nazis collapse the mine in order to destroy the Daemites, and Rayne departs for Germany to confront Wulf and prevent the G.G.G. from summoning Beliar. Unbeknownst to the Nazis, Castle Gaustadt is home to a clan of ancient vampires that, after centuries in isolation, have evolved into bestial monsters. One of these vampires, Hedrox, manages to obtain Beliar's heart, but does not know how to access its powers. While the feral vampires and Nazi soldiers attack each other, Rayne fights her way into the castle, where she encounters Mynce. Mynce reveals that she faked her death in order to infiltrate the G.G.G. and has been working as a double agent for Brimstone ever since. She warns Rayne that Wulf has already absorbed several of Beliar's relics into his own body, making him extremely dangerous. Shortly afterward, Wulf ambushes and kills Mynce, ripping her heart out in front of Rayne. A furious Rayne swears revenge on Wulf and pursues him into the castle's cathedral. In the cathedral, Rayne confronts Wulf and Hedrox. Hedrox consumes Beliar's heart, inadvertently summoning the demon into his own body . The revived Beliar demands that Rayne and Wulf return his stolen body parts, leading to a three-way fight between them. After a pitched battle, Rayne decapitates Wulf and banishes Beliar, leaving only his still-beating heart behind. Rayne briefly appears tempted by the power of Beliar's heart, but ultimately disposes of it by kicking it down a storm drain . Brimstone are pleased by Rayne's success and note that she deserves a rest, but they caution against the growing threat posed by another, even greater evil: Rayne's father, whom Brimstone has finally located. The game had a development budget of $2 million. The total budget was $6 million to $7 million. Development time was more than two years. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of BloodRayne received ""generally favorable reviews"", while the GameCube and PC versions received ""mixed or average reviews"", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PS2 version 7, 7.5 and 7.5 for a total of 7.33 out of 10. In Japan, where the same console version was ported and published by Electronic Arts on August 26, 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of 29 out of 40.",Terminal Reality,"PlayStation 2, Xbox NA : October 31, 2002 [ 2 ] EU : May 2, 2003 [ 1 ] GameCube NA : October 31, 2002 [ 2 ] EU : May 23, 2003 Windows EU : May 2, 2003 [ 1 ] NA : September 9, 2003 [ 3 ] Mac OS X NA : May 2, 2003 [ 4 ] Terminal Cut WW : November 20, 2020 ReVamped WW : November 18, 2021",PlayStation 2 Xbox GameCube Windows Mac OS X Terminal Cut Windows ReVamped Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X/S,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,,father,,body,,forcibly; kill,,evil; monster; vampire; witch,,

Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Premonition_2%3A_A_Blessing_in_Disguise,"Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is a survival horror video game developed by Toybox, White Owls, and Now Production for the Nintendo Switch . It was released on July 10, 2020 by Toybox in Japan and Rising Star Games internationally. It is both a prequel and sequel to Deadly Premonition , which has garnered a cult following since its release in 2010. A Blessing in Disguise follows FBI Agent Francis York Morgan as he works to solve a murder mystery in the fictional American town of Le Carré, Louisiana . Deadly Premonition 2 divides its gameplay between two sections. In the first, the player assumes the role of FBI Agent Aaliyah Davis, who interrogates Francis Zach Morgan in his apartment about his handling of a case involving the murder of a teenage girl. The gameplay of these sections consists mostly of visual novel style dialogue and point and click exploration of Zach’s apartment. In the second, the player guides a younger Francis York Morgan through the fictional American town of Le Carré, Louisiana, fourteen years prior, as he investigates that case and its connection to a drug ring. These sections are open world , and include side quests alongside the main story. Traversal of the open world is done via skateboard . During these sections, York has a gun that he can use to shoot Louisiana wildlife. There are interstitial combat levels during the main story. The frame story of Deadly Premonition 2 takes place in Francis Zach Morgan's apartment in Boston , Massachusetts , in 2019, a decade after the events of Deadly Premonition . There, FBI Special Agent Aaliyah Davis ( Mela Lee ) and her partner Simon Jones ( Christopher Corey Smith ) interrogate a sickly Zach (Jeff Kramer) over his involvement in a murder case of sixteen-year-old Lise Clarkson, the granddaughter of the influential Clarkson family, in Le Carré. Zach narrates how he and his alternate personality York, created from his childhood trauma, came to Le Carré to investigate the connections between the murder and an addictive street drug, Saint Rouge. During his investigation in Le Carré, York is periodically aided by riddles from the supernatural entity Houngan and Patricia ""Patti"" Woods ( Cassandra Lee Morris ). Patti is the young adopted daughter of the town's sheriff Melvin Woods ( Ogie Banks ), whose biological mother is his wife, Candy Clarkson. Returning to the scene of Lise's murder, York discovers that she had been dismembered by her mother Galena ( Kate Higgins ) in the presence of Professor R ( Billy Kametz ), whom York suspects to be involved in the production of Saint Rouge. York then enters the Otherworld, where he battles a monstrous version of Galena, who claims to have done it in pursuit of creating a new world. Returning to reality, he arrests Galena and takes her to the town's jail. The next day, he finds that Galena has been murdered and tracks down Professor R, revealed to be a trans woman named Lena Dauman. She had been born the heir to the Clarkson family and later became an apostle for the goddess of fertility after meeting the supernatural entity Forrest Kaysen (Joe Hernandez), using Saint Rouge to transform the bodies and mature the souls of selected human offerings to the goddess. York enters the Otherworld again to examine a scene of violence between Lena and her father, P.J. Clarkson ( David Lodge ). P.J laments his family's fading prestige, and in a plot twist reveals Lena had an incestuous affair with her elder sister Candy - which then resulted in a child, who is Patti. York then battles a monstrous form of Lena and returns to reality as the bomb Lena planted detonates, killing her and her father. After Melvin and then Patti go missing, York eventually tracks them down to a boathouse. Corrupted by Saint Rouge, Melvin confesses his love for Lena and plans to finish Lena's plan by sacrificing Patti. Melvin, however, changes his mind, and dies along with Candy in an ensuing fire, as Patti escapes with York. Back in the present, Zach enlists Simon Jones's help to track down Avery Smith (Armen Taylor), a developmentally disabled man infatuated with Lise. Zach returns to Le Carré, to the place where Lise's corpse was found, and confronts Avery in the Otherworld. Zach defeats Avery, but when he attempts to free Patti, he sees a vision of Patti admonishing him for not letting her die back at the boathouse as well as his inability to save Emily, his love interest in Deadly Premonition . Overwhelmed by his guilt over Emily's death, Zach gives into his anguish and is transformed into a monster by Kaysen. Aaliyah confronts Zach and fatally shoots him. When Aaliyah, influenced by Kaysen, tries to shoot Patti, York intervenes to save her and breaks Kaysen's supernatural hold over Aaliyah. Patti, distraught over Zach's impending death, makes a deal with York to prolong Zach's life. In the post-credits scene, Patti video calls Zach, as Zach and York communicate via text. According to Swery , he was ""being ghosted"" during the final months of development. He is quoted as saying that ""there were so many fixes needed that he submitted approximately 2,000 tickets and not only does he say they were never addressed, he also claims he never had a chance to talk to anybody from the publisher and the studio. I found out the game had been released thanks to a message I received from a fan"", he alleges. A Blessing in Disguise was announced in September 2019, with Hidetaka Suehiro (Swery65) as director and writer. It was published as an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch on July 10, 2020. A Windows port was released on June 12, 2022. Deadly Premonition 2 received mixed reviews upon release. Some critics concluded that the game did not reach the same heights as Deadly Premonition , with the other elements of the game unable to compensate for the technical performance, as had previously happened in Deadly Premonition . Others wrote that, while not quite as enjoyable as Deadly Premonition , it was still a serviceable sequel with an intriguing storyline and characters. The characters generally received praise as enjoyably eccentric, though some reviewers felt that the relatively smaller cast, as compared to Deadly Premonition , limited the narrative range of the murder mystery. York was similarly highlighted as a major strength of the narrative, with one reviewer describing him as ""undoubtedly Deadly Premonition 2 ' s saving grace"". A major point of criticism focused on the game's technical performance. Reviewers often criticized the frame rate as slow and considerably detracting from the experience of the game, particularly when exploring the outdoor portion of Deadly Premonition 2 ' s open world. The absence of an option to invert the game's camera along the Y-axis was also criticized, as it had been present in the 2019 port of Deadly Premonition for the Switch.

Emily Wants to Play,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Wants_to_Play,"Emily Wants to Play is a 2015 survival horror video game created by indie developer Shawn Hitchcock. The game was first released for macOS and Windows on December 10, 2015. It was later released for iOS , Android , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Oculus Rift in 2016. A sequel titled Emily Wants to Play Too was released on December 13, 2017. The player takes the role of a pizza delivery man that has been trapped in a house by a young girl named Emily and her three dolls. Each level of the game is represented by a different hour of the night from 11 pm until 6 am. During these levels, various combinations of the dolls and Emily appear. The player must learn how to interact with Emily and her dolls in order to survive the night. The game begins with the player character , a pizza delivery man, walking into a house on his last pizza delivery. Upon entering, the front door closes and is locked, presumably by Emily, since she appears for an instant in front of the door. The player must then survive the night from 11 pm until 6 am. Each hour of the game an antagonist is added in the form of a doll or Emily. The player must then figure out how to interact with each doll and Emily herself in order to survive the hours (6 minutes). If a doll or Emily attacks the player, in the form of a jump scare , then the player loses and the game is over. However, the player can retry from the beginning of the last hour. There are various clues on notes and on a whiteboard in the kitchen that help the player to learn how to handle a doll when it appears (although what's written on the whiteboard are usually lies meant to trick the player). The mechanic of each doll and Emily's game build upon each other. The player has to survive by performing tasks with the dolls in the form of children's games. At 11 PM, the toys never attack the player. However, the player can interact with the house. However, Emily will kill the player if they go into the hole that leads to the basement(all hours in the game, except 4 AM~6 AM). At 12 AM, Kiki (the porcelain doll) becomes hostile. When the player hears her laugh, it means she could either be right behind the player or somewhere in the room. If the player comes across her, they need to look at her until she vanishes. Only when she disappears is the player completely safe (until her laugh is audible again somewhere). At 1 AM, Mr. Tatters (the clown doll) becomes hostile. He will laugh and make sounds to detect the player's movement. If the player remains completely still, it is possible for them to avoid being attacked. He will also come in front of the player sometimes, but under no condition must the player move or click anywhere. After some time, he will sigh and leave the player alone. Once he disappears, the player is free to move around again. At 2 AM, Chester (the ventriloquist dummy) becomes hostile. He has a kid-like laugh. When he laughs, the player must run away from the room they're currently in to avoid being killed. The only way to escape him is by getting out of the room he is currently in. At 3 AM, all three dolls become hostile. The player has to memorize how to deal with the dolls separately. To make it more difficult, the player may encounter two dolls at the same time. At 4 AM, Emily (the demon-like girl) will become hostile. The player will see a timer on the bottom of the screen counting down. From this point on, the player will not be allowed to turn on any light switch. The player can, however, use a flashlight, which will make this part easier. The player can now can enter the basement without getting killed instantly by Emily, since she's already active. Once the player finds Emily, they must touch her, which will cause her to disappear, resetting the timer and causing her to teleport somewhere else. This process must be repeated. At 5 AM, Emily and her dolls will become hostile. The player must survive all of these enemies in combination. At 6 AM, the player can leave the house. A month ago, two people were found dead in the living room of their house located on a street called 905 Sister Street as they were packing up to move. A pizza is ordered to the house using an online pizza delivery service by what is presumably a deceased and ghostly girl named Emily Withers. A pizza delivery man who works at a company called Checkers Pizza (a spoof of Domino's Pizza ) comes to the house to fulfill the order. Details in the order explain that the door is open and to walk right in. When the pizza man walks in, announcing the delivery of the pizza, the door is closed and locked behind him. Emily briefly appears near the door when the lightning strikes, having apparently been responsible for locking the door. During his stay in the house, the pizza man encounters Emily and three living dolls named Kiki (a porcelain doll ), Mr. Tatters (a clown doll), and Chester (a ventriloquist dummy ). In one of the rooms, he finds a flashlight. Emily and the dolls want to play variations of children's games with the pizza man, namely peek-a-boo , red light green light , tag and hide-and-seek , but will kill him if he makes a wrong move. A whiteboard in the kitchen tells the opposite of what he has to do to survive (although it sometimes has comments or facts that are true). There is also a laptop in the kitchen that was used to order the pizza. If the pizza man plays these games correctly and survives from 11 pm to 6 am, Emily and the dolls will let him out of the house. According to the notes in the house, Emily was a girl who suffered depression and found comfort in the dolls in the basement. She considered the dolls her friends, but her parents wanted to take them away from her. The recordings left behind seem to be from Maggie Withers, Emily's mother, and were recorded to help with her cope with her own depression . The recordings explain that Emily acted strangely ever since they moved here, presumably because she didn't like her new home. Emily showed signs of erratic and violent behavior, which led her to harm other children at school and kill a puppy that they bought her as a gift. Because of this, her parents decided to keep her at home and lock her in the basement. During this time, Emily found the dolls, and even stranger events began occurring. The dolls started appearing around the house without anyone moving them, and Emily had opened up a giant hole in the floor of her room, which would be impossible for a small child to do. One day, Emily was found lifeless in the basement, having died of unknown circumstances, which scared the parents into planning to move to a new house. News audio that plays on a static television explains that a couple was killed a month ago while preparing to move. These two people are presumably Emily's parents, and someone, possibly Emily's angered ghost or one of her dolls, had killed them before they could move. There are hints of a possible subplot. The phrases ""Join Us"" and ""We Are One"" can be seen written on a few notes, on the bottom of a crashed computer and heard at the end of a recording in the basement. There is also a strange figure depicted behind what looks like Emily and her dolls on the back of one of the notes. When the pizza delivery man finally escapes, the police come back to check the house. The subsequent news report states that the pizza man is now under psychiatric evaluation , but the dolls matching his description have been recovered. Emily Wants to Play Too begins at 6 am in the protagonist's apartment, after having a large party. The protagonist has to get to work at Timmy Thom's Fast Sandwiches (a spoof of Jimmy John’s Sandwiches) by 4 pm. At this point, he decides to rest before that time. While the protagonist sleeps, he seems to have the same nightmare he has been having in his previous slumbers where he encountered Emily and her dolls. When he officially awakens, he takes a shower and washes dishes before delivering a sandwich order to a research facility known as Central Evidence. Arriving there at 7 pm, he gets locked in and witnesses Chester performing some sort of ritual. He later sees Kiki bringing Maxwell Steeles to life using a similar ritual. The protagonist's objective is to discover keycards that gain access to four area levels and survive until 7 am before he can escape Emily and her dolls and exit the building. During this time, they start a fire in the building to destroy evidence of their existence and confiscate fire extinguishers in the building. Whiteboards in the building provide hints to help the protagonist; however, some are lies used to deceive him. The game introduces three new dolls: Weasl, Maxwell Steeles (a man disguised as a store mannequin ), and Greta. The original dolls are still present. The newspaper articles found within the building explain the backstories of Emily and the six dolls, implying that they are possessed by an evil entity (presumed to be the spirit of a puppet master named Vult Ludere, who is the original owner of Kiki, Mr. Tatters, and Chester, and is possibly the figure that was depicted on one of the notes in the original game). Apart from the default ending, there are also two alternate endings in the game. The first can be achieved during the 6 am area at the player's apartment. If the player turns off the light, he will start to get scared. If he stays like this for over a minute, noises will be heard in the dark, suggesting that the dolls are gathering around him. Finally, the local journal reports that the protagonist died because he tripped and suffered a fatal injury. The second one can be achieved when he comes inside the Central Evidence for the first time where he sees Chester performing a ritual and runs away in terror. In the default ending, a file revealing the accident at the Central Evidence and the dolls are shown while also indicating that the protagonist is now under psychiatric evaluation. The police believe him to be responsible for the fire that destroyed Central Evidence. Because he didn't deliver the order, he lost his job. The man reading the story is hinted to be the pizza delivery man from the first game, who suggests that he should ""go back to that house."" As the credits roll, Emily and her dolls face a tall figure (presumably the entity mentioned in the newspapers), saying that it won't let her out anymore and now ""they are one."" Emily Wants to Play 3 does not have a known plot yet, but what is known so far is that the pizza delivery man and the sandwich delivery man from the previous two games will return along with a new character named Emilia Ludere and members of a company called PAH Inc. Their goal is to infiltrate the house that Emily Withers previously lived in. All enemies from the first two games will also return along with a new villain: Vult Ludere, the ghost influencing Emily and her dolls, who is also a possible relative of Emilia's due to them sharing the same last name. The developer, Shawn Hitchcock, announced that he will be releasing Emily Wants to Play on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, creating a VR update and a sequel titled Emily Wants to Play Too . A sequel, titled Emily Wants to Play 3 , has been confirmed, though no release date has been given. For the original game ( Emily Wants to Play ), review aggregator Metacritic found that the game received ""generally favourable reviews"". Gamespew praised the game's creation of a ""disconcerting atmosphere"" and effective jumpscares, but found the gameplay to be overly luck-based in luck at times. Similarly, Digitally Downloaded praised the effectiveness of the game's jumpscares but ultimately found it ""difficult to get invested"" in.",Shawn Hitchcock,"macOS , Windows December 10, 2015 iOS , Android January 30, 2016 PlayStation 4 August 9, 2016 Xbox One September 9, 2016 Oculus Rift October 31, 2016",macOS Windows iOS Android PlayStation 4 Xbox One Oculus Rift,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,delivery; mother,,depression,,escape; locked,kill; killed; violent,,evil; witch,girl; young; young girl,

Fatal Frame,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Frame_(video_game),"Fatal Frame is a survival horror video game developed by Tecmo for PlayStation 2 . The first entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was published by Tecmo in Japan (2001) and North America (2002), and by Wanadoo Edition in Europe in 2002. An expanded Xbox port was published by Tecmo in 2002 in North America (2002) and Japan (2003), and by Microsoft Game Studios in Europe in 2003. The story follows Miku Hinasaki, a spiritually-sensitive girl exploring the haunted Himuro Mansion in search of her brother Mafuyu. Gameplay follows Miku as she explores the Mansion, solving puzzles and fighting hostile ghosts using a mystical camera. Development began after the PlayStation 2 hardware was introduced to Tecmo. The concept was created by Makoto Shibata , who acted as director. He and producer Keisuke Kikuchi wanted to create the scariest gaming experience possible. Its atmosphere was inspired by Japanese horror and war movies, although some parts were cut due to graphic content. In North America, the game was marketed as being based on a true story. The game received generally positive reviews for its atmosphere and main gameplay mechanic, while the port drew praise for its improved visuals. A sequel, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly , was released in 2003. Fatal Frame is a survival horror video game set within an abandoned Japanese mansion, divided into a prologue tutorial and four chapters. The player controls Miku Hinasaki for the majority of the game, with the prologue featuring Miku's brother Mafuyu. Each part of the mansion includes a map of its layout, and each level is rendered in real-time instead of using pre-rendered backgrounds. During navigation, players guide the characters through multiple rooms, each with a semi-fixed camera perspective that changes depending on a character's position. Environments are invariably dark, with exploration being possible through the use of a flashlight. During exploration, various items can be found scattered through environments: these include documents and cassette recordings expanding on elements of the story, health items, and other objects. In some areas, the main character must also solve puzzles to progress. Progress is saved at savepoints through the mansion, and at the end of each chapter. Hostile ghosts can only be fought using the Camera Obscura, an antique camera that can capture ghosts. Ghosts in environments are sensed using a character's ""sixth sense"", and will drain a character's health on contact. When using the Camera, the view switches to a first-person view: the Camera Obscura's viewpoint is moved with the left analog stick on a controller, while the character is moved with the right stick while maintaining a view through the Camera. Holding a ghost in view enables greater damage, but ghosts fade in and out of view as they approach. The most damage is dealt when the ghost is very close. The amount of damage taken is converted into points, which are used to upgrade the camera for faster reload time or greater damage with each shot, or adding secondary powers such as staggering ghosts when shooting them. Points are also gained by photographing benign ghosts that appear in set spots around the mansion. Film, the Camera's ammunition, can be found throughout the mansion or be replenished at a save point: it comes in various grades, with higher-quality grades dealing higher damage while consequently being rarer. The story, set in the year 1986, focuses on orphaned siblings Miku and Mafuyu Hinasaki, who share the ability to sense and perceive supernatural events. When Mafuyu disappears in the haunted Himuro Mansion searching for his tutor Junsei Takamine and his assistants, Miku goes to Himuro Mansion. As she explores the mansion, Miku discovers signs that Takamine's party were killed by the mansion's ghosts, and finds rope burns appearing on her wrists and ankles, manifestations of a curse on anyone who enters Himuro Mansion. Further exploration through the mansion turns up information on a dark ritual that took place within Himuro Mansion: a chosen ""Rope Shrine Maiden"" was torn apart using ropes attached to her limbs and neck, then the ropes that killed her were soaked in her blood and used to seal the Hell Gate, a portal to the afterlife that keeps a dark force known as ""the Malice"" and the restless dead from escaping into the living world. The last sacrifice, Kirie Himuro, fell in love with a visitor prior to her death; while the Himuro family head had the man killed in secret, Kirie remained attached to the mortal world through her love for him. This attachment meant that her sacrifice did not seal the Hell Gate, allowing Malice to infest Himuro Mansion, with its inhabitants either dying or being driven mad. Kirie's spirit haunts the mansion in a splintered form; a child version who helps Miku at various points, and an adult version corrupted by Malice responsible for the curse which kills visitors. Mafuyu was captured by Kirie as he resembles her dead lover. Miku finally confronts Kirie's adult form at the Hell Gate, cleansing her spirit of Malice using an artifact called the Holy Mirror. With her spirit reformed, Kirie willingly becomes the Rope Shrine Maiden and uses her body to seal the Hell Gate permanently, freeing the spirits trapped in Himuro Mansion. The ending then diverges depending on the game's difficulty. In the ""Normal Mode"" ending, Mafuyu stays behind with Kirie to keep her spirit company while Miku escapes the Hell Gate's chamber as it collapses. In the ""Hard Mode"" ending, Kirie convinces Mafuyu to escape with his sister. A third ending, exclusive to the Xbox version, shows the spirit of Kirie's lover returning to her while Miku and Mafuyu escape. The concept for the game came to future director Makoto Shibata shortly after he finished work on Tecmo's Deception: Invitation to Darkness . The concept came to Shibata inspired by his own dreams and encounters with what he felt were supernatural occurrences. Development began when the PlayStation 2 hardware was first introduced to Tecmo, under the codename ""Project Zero"". One of the things they drew inspiration from was the positive reception of polygon characters in the Silent Hill series, using this to go a step further and create the sense of seeing things off-screen. The ultimate goal was to create as frightening an atmosphere as possible. The staff included multiple developers from the Deception series. According to character designer and CGI director Hitoshi Hasegawa, the game's key colors are black and white: white represented hope, while black represented fear. During early development, a large amount of effort went into adjusting the lighting and shading, with the most obvious in-game representation of the key colors and desired effect being Miku's torch piercing the darkness inside the mansion. In addition to black and white, a third key color represented through Miku's clothing was red, representing life. The music was composed by a team which included Ayako Toyoda and sound director Shigekiyo Okuda. One of the early decisions was using stereophonic sound to reinforce the atmosphere. Due to the nature of the project, Okuda considered it important that they convey a three-dimensional feeling using sound projected from both left and right. After testing out multiple middleware and commercial sound tools, the team settled on Arnis Sound Technologies. The setting of the game in a classical Japanese mansion originated from Shibata's early ideas for settings within the Deception series, although these ideas were passed over as it limited the possibilities for the series' trap-setting gameplay. When creating the atmosphere, the team watched both high and low-budget Japanese horror films, and war films. Kikuchi described Shibata as writing the entire story by himself. The script was written by Tsuyoshi Iuchi. The story was the first part of the game to be completed. The setting was originally going to be in the then-present day, but as the team wanted to create a feeling of isolation through a lack of modern technology such as mobile phones, the setting was changed to the 1980s. Some scenes were considered too graphic for the game and were cut: two cited examples were a flashback showing the head of the Himuro house committing seppuku, and another was a scene showing Kirie being torn apart during the Strangling Ritual. The way the Holy Mirror was broken also made a deliberate reference to how the ritual pulled the body into five pieces. While rituals form a core part of the story, the development team had little to no experience with such things. For inspiration, Shibata used similar motifs of spirituality in Yōkai Hunter , a manga written by Daijiro Morohoshi . The Camera Obscura was not in the initial discussions between Shibata and Kikuchi, with the original idea being that ghosts would be avoided and repelled by light. Ultimately, they decided to have a type of offensive power, which resulted in the Camera's creation. Kikuchi was initially opposed to the idea, but saw that it fitted very well into the game's context as development progressed. The Camera's design was based on a German military camera. The game was first announced in July 2001 for a winter release under the provisional title "" Project Zero "". The game's Japanese title was inspired by the nature of the game's enemies as ""beings of nothingness"", along with it representing the state of someone being at their utmost during a decisive moment. It could also be read alternately as ""zero"" and ""ghost"". The game was initially dated for December 7, but Tecmo later shifted the date forward to December 13. As part of the promotion campaign, two special giveaways were created and sold through Japanese media store Tsutaya: headphones given away to winners of a lottery, and a trial version available to rent. In addition to this, a novelization written from the point of view of Mafuyu was published by ASCII Media Works . The game's release for North America was confirmed in January 2002 to be March 8, but the title was instead made available on February 27. The title was marketed in North America as being based on a true story. While this was not true in itself, elements of the story were based on real haunted locations and local Japanese legends. Two cited examples were a haunted mansion said to be the site of numerous murders, and the legend of a tree from which a woman hanged herself when forcefully separated from her lover. In Europe, it was published as Project Zero by Wanadoo , a publishing company based in France. Wanadoo had their eye on the game since its Japanese release, and took charge of its translation and promotion for the region. It was released on the region on August 30, 2002. An expanded port for the Xbox , titled Fatal Frame Special Edition , was released on November 27, 2002 in North America, February 6, 2003 in Japan, and May 2, 2003 in Europe. The Japanese release used the game's American title as opposed to its Japanese title. Tecmo published the port in Japan and North America, while the game was published by Microsoft Game Studios in Europe. The port featured graphical upgrades, new ghosts to fight, a redesigned interface for the camera, bonus costumes for Miku, and a new ""Fatal"" difficulty mode. Completing the game on this difficulty unlocked an art gallery. The game was re-released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in North America on April 9, 2013 as a PlayStation 2 Classic . During 2001, Fatal Frame sold just over 42,000 units in Japan, ranking among the top 300 best-selling games of that year. Upon its release in Europe, the PS2 version sold 12,000 copies. According to an interview with Kikuchi and Shibata, the game was an unexpected success in both North America and Europe. The two attributed this to the recent popularity of Japanese horror films like Ring . The PS2 version met with ""mixed or average"" reviews according to review aggregation website Metacritic , earning a score of 74 out of 100 based on 22 critic reviews. Famitsu praised the use of the Camera Obscura in creating a sense of tension in combination with the sound and visual design. IGN 's David Smith, while noting some difficulties with the controls, generally praised its atmosphere and gameplay, saying that ""horror fans are advised to pick this one up at their leisure, and even the jaded might find something to renew their interest in the genre"". Chris Baker of 1UP.com similarly praised the atmosphere and enjoyed the gameplay, particularly noting its ability to make him feel like a newcomer to gaming with its late-game difficulty spike. GameSpot 's Miguel Lopez was generally positive, enjoying the game despite faulting some of the textures and particle effects: in conclusion, he said that fans of the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series would enjoy the game. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer , while initially wary of the game, was impressed by the game, calling it ""compelling and utterly addictive"" and citing multiple parallels with Ring . GamePro was less enthusiastic, saying that it did not hold up well alongside games like Silent Hill . Chris Hudak of Game Revolution gave strong praise to the game's atmosphere, but faulted the Camera Obscura's need for ghosts to be within the targeting area to score points, and some over-familiar elements similar to other horror games of the time. The Xbox version saw a more positive reception, with Metacritic giving a score of 77 out of 100 based on seventeen reviews. GameSpy 's Raina Lee, reviewing the Xbox version, called it ""the only really scary game"" on the console at the time. Lee was particularly positive about the improvements despite them not being substantial when compared to other expanded re-releases of the time, recommending it to players who had yet to try the original version. IGN 's Aaron Boulding likewise noted the graphical upgrade, while saying that players of the original version would find little to attract them again aside from the new difficulty mode. Eurogamer 's Kristan Reed, echoing Fahey's sentiments about the game, called it one of the best games on the Xbox, positively noting the added features and graphical upgrade. GamePro , while again faulting it when compared to other horror games, was generally positive about the upgrade, calling it ""a solid choice for horror fanatics, especially considering that genre offerings on the Xbox are few and far between"". Ricardo Torres of GameSpot was less enthusiastic about the graphical upgrade, but praised the improved sound quality and called it a sound game in the genre. The success of Fatal Frame prompted Tecmo to turn the concept into a series. Since the original game's release, the gameplay has remained generally unchanged, becoming a defining part of the series' identity. A standalone sequel, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly , was released in 2003 in Japan and North America, and 2004 in Europe. A further sequel, Fatal Frame III: The Tormented , was released in 2005 in Japan and North America and 2006 in Europe. The first three Fatal Frame titles form a loosely-connected trilogy, with The Tormented continuing narrative elements from the first two titles. Shortly after the game's release, a Hollywood film adaptation was announced in 2003. Based on the game's story and intended to be set in Japan as opposed to a Western country, Robert Fyvolent and Mark R. Brinker were to be the writers and John Rogers was the producer. Steven Spielberg has been brought in to polish the script. After a long period of hiatus, the film was re-announced in 2014, this time produced by Samuel Hadida , and was set to begin production after the completion and release of the fifth Fatal Frame title Maiden of Black Water .

Forbidden Siren 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Siren_2,"Forbidden Siren 2 is a 2006 survival horror stealth game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 . It is a sequel to 2003's Siren ( Forbidden Siren ) and was not released in North America. A film inspired by the game but featuring a different plot and characters, Siren , was released that same year. The game tells the story of several characters who become trapped on Yamijima Island, off the coast of mainland Japan. In 1976, during a blackout , the entire population of the island disappeared without a trace or explanation. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a journalist is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes. Shortly after this, a group of soldiers crash land on the island. The game is played from the perspective of these characters, and out of chronological order, as the protagonists attempt to survive the island's monsters and discover its mystery. Like its predecessor, Forbidden Siren 2 is divided into numerous scenarios, organized chronologically in a table called the ""Link Navigator"". In order to complete a scenario, the player must accomplish a primary mission objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, finding an item, or subduing certain enemies (called shibito ( 屍人 , shibito ; lit. ""corpse people"") and the yamibito ( 闇人 , yamibito ; lit. ""darkness people"") ). Objectives are interconnected via a butterfly effect , and a character's actions in one scenario can trigger a secondary objective in another. The game's defining feature is ""sightjacking,"" to see and hear from the perspectives of nearby shibito, yamibito, humans, and other creatures. The process is similar to tuning into a radio frequency , with the left analog stick serving as the dial. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player, and the direction of the dial depends on the target's orientation to the player. Once a signal is found, it can be assigned to one of the controller's four face buttons to switch between signals. Via sightjacking, the player can discover a shibito's position, patrol route, locations and items of interest. However, the player is unable to move while sightjacking and is vulnerable to attack. In Forbidden Siren 2 , the sightjack system was altered to allow automatic sightjacking to the closest enemy without having to tune into its frequency. Character-specific features have been added, such as Shu's ability to move while sightjacking, Ikuko's ability to control sightjacked enemies, and Akiko's ability to reveal psychic impressions from the past when sightjacking in certain areas. Also added is the ability to crouch-walk, a proximity alert that warns the player of nearby enemies, a hint system that guides the player to the current mission objective, three selectable difficulty levels, and an optional first-person mode . Context-sensitive interactions now require only a single button press rather than having to bring up the list menu, and bringing up the menu for common interactions no longer pauses the game. Important items remain in the inventory if a player is killed instead of needing to be reattained. The combat system has also been overhauled; characters can now use a three-hit combo attack and attack barehanded. Guns can be used as melee weapons, and there are many more weapons available. The sequel also introduces a new enemy type - the yamibito, who are more resilient, aggressive, and intelligent. They are repelled by light, and can be weakened by a flashlight or turning on the lights in a room. Like the shibito, a yamibito can be defeated, but is revived when a yamirei ( 闇霊 , yamirei ; lit. ""darkness spirit"") re-enters the corpse. Eliminating the yamirei (who are also intolerant to light) renders the yamibito unconscious indefinitely, but yamibito will not fall for distractions that may work on shibito, and are much harder to defeat in combat. As in the original, items scattered through scenarios give the player insight into the story. Once obtained, these items are collected in a catalog called ""Archives"" and can be viewed at any time. The catalog has been expanded to include additional media types such as audio, video, and other interactive supplements. Millennia ago, Mother was an ancient water deity who was imprisoned below the earth upon the creation of light. Mother's mate, Otoshigo, fled to the depths of the ocean. Over time, Mother has been determined to return to the surface, and has sent out avatars (possessed human beings whom she controls) to prepare for her return. However, they continually fail their mission, and never return to the Underworld. In 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to Yamijima Island was lost. Four-year-old Shu Mikami finds a young woman washed up on the shore. The woman, Kanae, bears an extraordinary resemblance to Shu's dead mother. The two become inseparable and Kanae moves in with Shu and his father. The Yamijima locals fear her because of her aversion to sunlight. Kanae is actually an avatar of Mother, tasked with manipulating Shu into opening the seven gates of the Underworld, which are located on Yamijima Island, and keep Mother imprisoned. Before Kanae can complete her mission, Tsuneo Ohta, the head of a group of fishermen, determines she must be killed. On a stormy night, Shu is awoken by the villagers, who have caught Kanae killing his father. Shu discovers the body but flees when he sees a man in the doorway of the house – the man is in fact his older self. Kanae escapes the villagers and reunites with Shu. Trapped by the group on the pier, the stone walkway gives out beneath them and they fall into the ocean. Shu swims to a small boat, but watches Kanae drown; the experience is so traumatic that he goes blind. Meanwhile, Mother sends a tsunami to destroy the villagers in revenge. Local authorities can't explain how Yamijima's undersea power cable was severed, or how the entire population of the island disappeared. In 2005, Ryuko Tagawa has been sent to earth as another avatar. She finds living as a human so comfortable that she forgets her original purpose and settles into a normal life. Meanwhile, Yuri Kishida, an innocent young girl, is kidnapped by Mother and hidden in a warehouse in Sanzu Harbor. Mother creates another avatar using Yuri's identity, and sends her to visit Ryuko, killing her for failing in her mission. Yuri then heads to Sanzu Harbor to watch the departure of the protagonists for Yamijima Island, as Mother knows that the person who will release her is among them. At the harbor a grown Shu, Mamoru Itsuki, Soji Abe, Akiko Kiyota and Ikuko Kifune board a small boat heading for Yamijima Island. Mamoru wants to investigate the mystery of 1976 for a magazine article. Shu is returning to the island in an attempt to rediscover lost childhood memories. Soji is Ryuko's flatmate who has been accused of her murder and, along with Akiko, is fleeing to the island. Ikuko is a dock worker on the boat as a deckhand , but finds herself drawn to the island. A large mass passes the boat unseen, the waves turn red, and a tsunami capsizes the vessel, splitting the passengers up. A military helicopter carrying Private Yorito Nagai, Major Takeaki Misawa and Sergeant Hiroshi Okita crashes on Yamijima Island, killing Okita. Okita transforms into a shibito, forcing Yorito to shoot him. Already on the island is Shigeru Fujita, a police officer who has come to investigate reports of a young woman on the apparently deserted island. Also present is Ichiko Yagura, a young schoolgirl, who awakens on board the Bright Win, a ferry that has run aground. The ferry disappeared during a tsunami in 1986, but has inexplicably appeared in the present day, with Ichiko its only passenger. Meanwhile, the villagers who disappeared in 1976 have also reappeared on the island in the present day. Awakening on the pier, Mamoru sets out to explore. He encounters a shibito, then meets Yuri, who tells him her mother is imprisoned ""in the island"", and she needs help to save her. They are accosted by Tomoe, who attacks Yuri, calling her a witch, and accusing her of being the same entity as Kanae. Mamoru and Yuri flee, then encounter Yorito and Takeaki. Yuri is afraid of them, and can't bear the light from their torches. As the group talk, a red tsunami appears and an earthquake rocks the island as a siren rings out. Meanwhile, Shu awakens near his old house, which is unchanged from 1976. He enters to see his four-year-old self holding the body of his dead father. Tsuneo arrives, intending to kill Kanae, but Shu's father resurrects as a shibito and chases him. Elsewhere, Shigeru meets Ichiko, the girl from the ferry, and they run into Tsuneo, who transforms into a shibito and attacks them. He corners them in an ammo depot, but Ichiko smiles at him, causing him to panic and flee. Meanwhile, Tomoe is chased by a group of shibito, and falls down a ravine, fatally impaling herself on an antenna. After surviving the tsunami, Takeaki and Yorito board the Bright Win. Takeaki acts strangely, having taken some hallucinogenic medication, and Yorito leaves him. Elsewhere, Soji was separated from Akiko, but encounters Shu, and they head to an abandoned amusement park, where Shu believes he can rediscover his lost memories. Meanwhile, Yuri leads Mamoru to the same park, where she manipulates him into opening the seven gates to the Underworld. She then reveals her true form, Mother. Ikuko arrives and uses her psychic power to bring Mamoru back to his senses. Soji sees Mother as Ryuko, whilst Shu sees Mother as Kanae. Unable to resist her call, Shu gives himself over to her and is enveloped. Elsewhere on the island, Mother's siren sounds, signifying her release, prompting Ichiko to kill Shigeru. Back in the Underworld, Mother, now free from her prison, gives birth to hundreds of yamirei - albino slug-like creatures. Soji, Akiko, Ikuko and Mamoru flee, but Ikuko and Mamoru become trapped. As they are about to be killed, a group of shiryos (the spirits that animate the dead into shibito) pour down into the abyss and fight the yamirei, giving Ikuko and Mamoru the opportunity to escape. Back in the park, Ikuko destroys the seven gates, preventing the Underworld from releasing any more yamirei. Those already released become yamibito and begin converting the island's shibito. Mamoru and Ikuko escape through the amusement park and are surrounded by yamirei, but dawn breaks, and the light-sensitive yamirei are destroyed. Ikuko tells Mamoru they are both on their own now, and leaves. Coming back to her senses, Ichiko is horrified to see Shigeru's corpse at her feet. She has a flashback of falling overboard the Bright Win and sinking to the bottom of the ocean. She was resurrected and possessed by Otoshigo, Mother's mate. Meanwhile, Shigeru is resurrected as a yamibito. Takeaki encounters Ichiko, and demands answers. Yorito appears, and, fearing for Ichiko's life, shoots Takeaki in the back. Yorito leaves with Ichiko and they are attacked by a dog-like yamibito. Ichiko flees, and again becomes possessed by Otoshigo and mindlessly kills any yamibito she encounters. Yorito finds Ichiko's bracelet, and uses it to bring her back to her senses. Meanwhile, Mamoru boards the Bright Win to destroy as many yamibito as he can, knowing it was his fault they were released. He discovers that Tomoe has transformed into a dog yamibito roaming the ship. Having fled the Underworld, Akiko notices a massive pylon reaching into the sky. She follows a psychic trail to where Shu and Kanae fell into the sea in 1976. Shu contacts Akiko from beyond the grave and asks her to save his father, Ryuhei, who has transformed into a kou-yamibito, a grotesque human/yamirei creature much stronger and more deadly than a normal yamibito. Shu leads her to a sacred tree branch which is traditionally used to keep evil spirits from the dead. Akiko finds a mysterious artifact, the Anunnaki Remains. Eventually, she destroys Ryuhei, stabbing him with the branch and freeing his soul. His body transforms into the Mekkoju tree. Akiko receives another vision – Ryuhei's murder. In the vision, Kanae flees, covered in Ryuhei's blood, but as she passes a mirror she sees Akiko's face. In the real world, Akiko collapses, and when she raises her head, she now looks and sounds like Kanae/Yuri. No longer able to resist Mother's power, she becomes another avatar. Ikuko discovers the Anunnaki Remains lodged into the Mekkoju tree, now entwined in the tower. With it, she destroys Shigeru, who has turned into a kou-yamibito, freeing his soul. Meanwhile, on the Bright Win, Mamoru and Yorito scale the tower. Mamoru believes their current reality is fake, a copy of the real world where time has folded back on itself. He believes the pylon reaches the point where two worlds intersect, and that is where Mother will pass from the fake reality into the real one. He and Yorito ascend the tower and obtain a Mekkoju branch for Tsuneo, now also a kou-yamibito. Tsuneo knocks Yorito off the tower, but Mamoru destroys him, also freeing his soul. Having survived his fall, Yorito vows to destroy every yamirei and yamibito. He discovers the yamirei are living in an old school and destroys it with a flare gun. He kills and frees the soul of Okita, before being confronted by Takeaki, transformed into a kou-yamibito. Yorito defeats Takeaki, but Ichiko appears, her face swollen into a single eye. She transforms into Otoshigo and attacks Yorito. He destroys the creature, celebrating, as he believes the nightmare is over. Back on the tower, Ikuko and Mamoru are reunited. Ikuko stabs Tomoe with the Mekkoju branch, freeing her soul. Mother scales the tower to reach the real world, and the tower crumbles as the fake reality fractures. Mamoru and Ikuko are sucked into Mother's plane of existence. As they battle her, Akiko/Kanae appears, imploring Shu's forgiveness. Akiko exerts control over her body, and kills herself by plunging the Annunaki Remains into her stomach, injuring Mother, and allowing Mamoru and Ikuko to destroy her. Another red tsunami washes over the island as the fake reality is replaced with the real one, and the timeline is purged. Lying together on the pier, Mamoru and Ikuko are bathed in sunlight as dawn breaks. Looking into the sun, Ikuko squints, as if the light hurts her eyes. Soji is joined on the beach by Tsukasa, and together, they look out at the sun. With the purging of the timeline Soji's past has changed. In the wake of Mother's death, Ryuko Tagawa never existed, so Soji is no longer a wanted felon. Elsewhere, Yorito awakens on a dimly lit boulevard. He notices yamibito strolling past, casually going about everyday activity; one pushing a pram, one purchasing items from a stall, child yamibito playing. The sun is hidden beyond a permanent total eclipse . Unable to tell if what he is seeing is reality or an illusion, he screams and opens fire on the yamibito, gunning down many as they flee. At the very end, Kyoya Suda, the protagonist of the first game, arrives on Yamijima Island with the Homuranagi sword and the Uryen, swearing he will destroy every monster still lurking on the island. The western release had both Japanese and English audio unlike the last game which only had English audio. The game was released on February 9, 2006, in Japan on the PlayStation 2. The game never received a North American release. Forbidden Siren 2 received ""average"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Eurogamer ' s Kristan Reed said that the game improved on many of the problems of the predecessor (especially the difficulty level and trial-and-error nature of the gameplay), but simultaneously fell somewhat short of the original. VideoGamer.com's Chris Pickering (a fan of Siren ) also said that the game removed many of the problems inherent to the original but fell short in many respects. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three nines and one eight for a total score of 35 out of 40. Siren (サイレン) is a film adaptation of Forbidden Siren 2 . It was released in Japan on February 9, 2006, to coincide with the Japanese release of the game.

Life Weaver,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Weaver,"Life Weaver is an action and survival horror video game published and developed by American studio BGG Productions. The game was released on January 10, 2012 for PC, and it is playable via optical disc. The single-player game was rated M for Mature by the ESRB for containing blood and gore, intense violence and strong language. Players control a group of party members that can be interchanged with other characters outside of battle. Players begin the game with only the main protagonist Celeste as a playable characters, but more characters will become playable as the player progresses through the game. The combat system is a modernized version of the turn-based battle system used in many older role-playing video games . Players will gain experience points upon winning a battle, and characters will level up to become stronger and gain new abilities when they have obtained enough experience points. Money and items can also be received upon successfully completing a battle. Players will travel to many different towns during the course of the game. Towns act as a safe haven for players where items can be bought or sold, and characters can rest to regain their strength. Some towns will contain missions that players can unlock by talking to NPCs , and mini games can be played in certain towns as well. Most missions in the game take place inside of a dungeon, cave, forest or other type of dark area inhabited by monsters. Battles can occur in these areas by either walking up to a monster or by having a monster walk up to you. Some battles in the game are predetermined and cannot be avoided. There are a variety of monsters in the game ranging from the common bumblebee to the ferocious Helfen. There are also boss battles such as one of your many encounters with Santa Claus . Much of Life Weaver's setting, plot and storyline is adapted from author Amanda Dyar's published short story Broken Light . The video game is set in an unspecified time period, although it appears to be an alternate present where some technologies have flourished, while others, such as the automobile, were never invented. The events in the game take place 100 years after the first Life Weaver foretold a prophecy about an approaching darkness and the one mortal woman who had the power to stop the darkness. The story of Life Weaver takes place on an unnamed planet constructed of three primary kingdoms and a province called The North Pole , similar to the North Pole in our own society. The game also features an alternate plane of existence that is home to the Life Weavers known as Coelum where there are many beautiful palaces, and magic thrives over technology. Life Weaver begins with the young Daniels couple going about their daily lives in a rural area of the Kingdom of Dalastria. Dalastria's chief export is farmed goods, so the kingdom is naturally littered with many different farms and small towns, although the capital city is quite large and highly populated. Soon after the game begins, the couple makes their way to the Kingdom of Hadrion, the largest kingdom of the three which features The Mantra Research Facility. Hadrion is the most populated of all the kingdoms, and there are many large buildings sitting within the city, and vendors can be seen on every street corner selling their goods and services. The Mantra Research Facility lies within the heart of Hadrion, and it is large enough to house a small community within its walls. The third kingdom is an enormous mining colony located in the world's largest mountain expansion. Little is known about the kingdom, because the place does not take kindly to outsiders, and few citizens bother leaving the kingdom for any reason. The North Pole is similar to what you'd hear in children's Christmas story, complete with elves, reindeer and Santa Claus himself. However, the cheery atmosphere is just a front for a much darker and evil plot. There are many other small towns, dungeons and other explorable environments located within the world of Life Weaver that players must venture through in order to beat the game as well. Two Life Weavers, Zerion and Zane are discussing strategies for an upcoming confrontation with the darkness. The key to their plans is finding a young woman named Celeste Daniels, who has been foretold to be the savior of Coelum from the darkness. Meanwhile, Celeste and her husband Anthony are going about their daily routine unaware of the impending danger. Celeste has a dream about the approaching darkness and the world she must save. The couple head to the Kingdom of Hadrion the next day for Anthony to find a job at The Mantra Research Facility. After Anthony attains his new job, he comes up missing, and Celeste will do anything to see her husband again. Life Weaver then shows the progression of the story through two perspectives, that of Anthony's who has been teleported to The North Pole and Celeste who is traveling the three kingdoms looking for any sign of Anthony. Celeste encounters many allies and enemies during her travels, and eventually masters her powers she had never known she possessed before her journey began. Celeste finally learns of Anthony's true whereabouts, and she pursues her husband in the same way he ended up in his current location. At the same time, Anthony learns of a sinister plot put in motion by the evil Santa Claus and his elf minions to destroy the world. After Celeste's long journey and Anthony's struggle for survival, the couple reunites and faces off in a final confrontation with the evil elf headmaster. BGG Productions officially announced the release of Life Weaver on January 10, 2012. Life Weaver was first mentioned in a print newspaper in Alabama where the game was developed. Life Weaver has received many positive reviews. The HorrorNews.net article claimed that, ""If you're a fan of old-style RPGs , or simply just a fan of fun games with great storylines, Life Weaver is for you."" The game also received two thumbs up from Gaming Podcast for its sense of classic gameplay and storytelling mixed with modern advancements in both graphics and gameplay mechanics.",BGG Productions,"January 10, 2012",Windows,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,,husband,,,,violence,,evil; monster,young,
Little Goody Two Shoes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Goody_Two_Shoes_%28video_game%29,"Little Goody Two Shoes is a video game developed by AstralShiftPro and published by Square Enix Collective . It includes elements of role-playing , adventure and horror games, and has an anime -inspired visual style. Players control a girl called Elise, who attempts to avoid horrific monsters in the enchanted woods while searching for a way to escape her mundane life. The game is a prequel to the 2016 RPG Maker game Pocket Mirror . A young girl named Elise is found by an elderly woman in the woods. Years later, after her adoptive grandmother dies, Elise performs odd jobs for the nearby villagers while fantasizing about wealth and adventure. Players control Elise as she investigates rumors of a wish-granting creature in the woods, and why horrific monsters have started coming out at night. During the day, players can perform jobs for the villagers and build relationships, including going on dates with up to three different female love interests. The jobs are action-oriented minigames , and relationships use elements of life sims and dating sims . During the night, players must guide Elise through the woods and avoid monsters. If players do not maintain positive relations with the villagers, they may accuse Elise of being a witch responsible for the monsters' appearance. Elise dies if caught by the monsters, and players must also balance her hunger and sanity.  If Elise dies, players can return to a save point . There are ten different endings based on choices players make, such as who to romance. The developer of the game, AstralShift, is based in Portugal . They were influenced by Mahō shōjo anime (magical girl anime targeting young women) from the 1990s, including Sailor Moon , Revolutionary Girl Utena , Magic Knight Rayearth , and Slayers .  In particular, they wanted Elise to emulate the strong female protagonists of these shows, both in design and writing.  The world was influenced by the video games Legend of Mana , SaGa Frontier , and horror games made in RPG Maker .  Though the story connects with their previous game, Pocket Mirror , Little Goody Two Shoes was designed to be standalone. It was initially designed to be a short prequel to that game, but they said it progressively grew in scale during preproduction in 2019 and 2020. Square Enix Collective released it for Windows, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on October 31, 2023. Little Goody Two Shoes received positive reviews on Metacritic . RPGamer praised the combination of genres but found the action sequences and puzzles frustrating. Nintendo Life similarly praised the mix of genres and criticized the puzzles. Push Square called it ""an excellent life-sim adventure"" but said it can become repetitive. RPGSite enjoyed the story, gameplay, and anime-inspired presentation, and they said the mix of genres was handled well by gradually introducing new gameplay elements without overwhelming players. Sports Illustrated praised the mix of influences and genres, which they said were impressively brought together.  Although they criticized the puzzles and some of the writing, they said AstralShift ""nailed the retro anime style"". RPGFan designated it the best adventure game/visual novel of 2023, calling it ""scary good"" and ""candy for the eyes"" for its retro RPG Maker look. In the 35th GLAAD Media Awards , Little Goody Two-Shoes was nominated for Outstanding Video Game .",AstralShiftPro,"WW : October 31, 2023",Nintendo Switch PlayStation 5 Windows Xbox Series X/S,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,mother,,,,escape,,,creature; monster; witch,girl; young; young girl,

Maid of Sker,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_of_Sker_%28video_game%29," Maid of Sker ( / s k ɛər / ) is a 2020 first-person survival horror game developed and published by Wales Interactive . The game is set in 1898 in the Sker Hotel, on an imaginary island called Sker Island. The protagonist, Thomas Evans, is invited by his lover, Elisabeth Williams, to uncover the mysteries of the hotel after she notices her family's strange behavior. While exploring the hotel, Thomas learns cult followers called ""The Quiet Ones"" control the place. He finds notes and gramophone records scattered around the hotel that reveal the history of Elisabeth's family. Several Welsh and British folklore tales provided inspiration for the story. One particular source was Sker House —a historic place situated just outside the town of Porthcawl , near Bridgend , Wales—made famous by The Maid of Sker , the three-volume novel written by R. D. Blackmore . The folklore story of the same name titled Y Ferch o'r Sger in Welsh also influenced the game. The game has been compared to Outlast , The Evil Within 2 , and Silent Hill . Its saving system was compared to that of Resident Evil , with the typewriter switched to a gramophone in the saving rooms. The game was released on 28 July 2020 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One , and on 26 November 2020 for Nintendo Switch . Critical reception to Maid of Sker was mixed, with reviewers praising the visuals and plot while criticising the gameplay mechanics. A spiritual successor, titled Sker Ritual , launched in 2024 for Windows, PlayStation 5 , and Xbox Series X/S . In Maid of Sker, players take on the role of Thomas Evans, as he navigates through the eerie and abandoned Sker Hotel in 1898. Using a first-person perspective, players must outsmart the hotel's blind enemies known as ""The Quiet Ones,"" who have the ability to track Thomas down by the noise he makes. Since Thomas is unable to fight back, players must utilize stealth and distraction tactics to sneak past the enemies and safely explore the hotel grounds. This means avoiding noise at all costs, holding one's breath when near a Quiet One, and carefully navigating through environments to avoid coughing or rustling objects. Mid-game, players are given a temporary weapon called the Phonic Modulator, which uses shock waves to temporarily damage the enemies' hearing and stun them. However, players must use this weapon sparingly as ammunition is limited. The game features a manual save style; there is no autosave . To save the game, the player has to find "" safe rooms "". These rooms have green-tinted patterned doors, and inside the rooms are gramophones the player has to play to save the game. This saving system has been compared to that in the Resident Evil games. The game has also been compared to Outlast in terms of its gameplay style, and The Evil Within 2 and Silent Hill for its atmosphere. The game includes puzzles and missions to unlock special keys that grant access to different areas of the map, as well as collecting brass cylinders and optional collectible doll figures that act as music boxes. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases, making it harder to save, find ammunition and healing items, and survive against the more aggressive enemies. The game is set in 1898, in the remote Sker Hotel located on the fictional Sker Island. The protagonist, Thomas Evans, receives a letter from Elisabeth Williams, the hotel owner's daughter, in which she tells him she is trapped and in danger. Along with the letter, Elisabeth sends a locket that belonged to her mother, which plays a tune. She asks Thomas to write a counter-song to the tune and bring it with him when he comes to the hotel, saying it will make sense later. Upon arriving at the hotel, Thomas is greeted by a gloomy atmosphere and finds the front gate locked. Guided by a dog, he finds a way into the hotel and soon discovers that the people inside are abnormal and cannot see. Elisabeth, who has locked herself in the attic, warns him that the place is no longer safe and tasks him with finding four brass cylinders her father hid on the hotel grounds. She tells Thomas that if they are played on a harmonium, things will return to normal. As Thomas explores the hotel, he learns about a cult called ""The Quiet Ones"" that the family belonged to and that Elisabeth's mother served as a priestess. The cult had planned to control the powers of a Siren they found in a sunken ship near the hotel. Elisabeth was trying to write a counter-song to reverse the effects of the Siren, and asked Thomas and three other composers to help her. Thomas must find the other three musical pieces scattered around the hotel and decide how to end the game. If he has found all the musical notes and all the cylinders, he can choose to trust Elisabeth and give her the cylinders, or to perform the song himself. Depending on the player's choices, the game will have a different ending. The video game ""Maid of Sker"" is a first-person survival horror game developed by Wales Interactive using Unity engine. It was originally scheduled for release in 2019 and was released on July 28, 2020, for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Nintendo Switch version was later released on November 26, 2020. The game draws inspiration from Welsh folklore tales such as ""Y Ferch o'r Sger"" and the historic Sker House in Wales, which was made famous by R.D. Blackmore's book of the same name. The game follows the story of a man named Thomas Evans and his love interest, Elisabeth Williams, a high-class woman. Elisabeth's father, Isaac, disapproves of the relationship and in one version of the tale, locks her in a room until she starves. Other versions of the tale include Elisabeth dying from a broken heart or being forced to marry someone she does not love and dying from an illness. The game incorporates elements of the folk story, including the haunted Sker House which is said to be haunted by Elisabeth and a sailor ghosts. The game's core survival mechanic is a 3D sound-based AI system, and it is influenced by the psychological horror genre with gothic elements. Maid of Sker received ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic . Andrew King of GameSpot rated the game 4 out of 10, writing that the story and surroundings were initially interesting, but the overall gameplay experience became increasingly disappointing and occasionally frustrating, and took issue with the predictable plot development and ending. Eurogamer writer Vikki Blake thought the gameplay was frustrating at times, but she found the overall experience became more enjoyable over time. She lamented the lack of emotional connection to the game's protagonist, Thomas, and concluded that Maid of Sker ""does little to surprise the player or push the genre forward"". Hooked Gamers praised the game for its music and beautiful scenery while criticizing it for not being complex enough, giving the game a 90/100. GamerMAG praised the game's sound and graphic design, but criticised it for ""unkillable opponents and several strange design solutions"", giving it an 80/100. GameSpace , Gamers' Temple , and The Games Machine rated the game 8/10, praising the game's narrative. Jeuxvideo.com criticised faults revolving around the AI while praising the game's story. Wccftech criticised the game for ""not breaking the mold of the Resident Evil formula in any significant way"" and not being innovative enough, however they praised the game for its horror elements, rating it 73/100. Edge rated the game a 5/10 and criticised its slow pacing. PC Invasion rated it a 4/10, writing, ""while the game has great visuals and design, everything else, from its gameplay systems to its progression and foes, is so weak and ill-considered that I can't imagine most people enjoying what little it has to offer"". Meristation rated it 6.8/10, noting the inspiration its story drew from the styles of authors Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft , but criticised the game's stealth mechanic and save system.

While exploring the surrounding woods, Giulia finds the corpse of her boyfriend, Lapo, a soldier of the Italian resistance , before she's shot. Irene finds Giulia and she recovers, though her story is misconstrued in the local newspaper. After Martha's funeral, Giulia indirectly reveals her identity to her mother by playing the piano. Suspecting that her mother played a role in her sister's death, Giulia obtains instructions to contact the White Lady from her Nanny. After using tarot cards to communicate with her on the island, Giulia obtains the key to her sister's trinket box and wakes up in her estate. In Martha's trinket box, Giulia finds a letter from Martha explaining she feigned deaf after Irene frightened her during their childhood. She explains that she felt guilty about Irene's favorism towards her and her disdain towards Giulia, and intended to enrage and be murdered by Irene while Irene was under the impression that she murdered Giulia, so that Giulia could take Martha's place. Martha also confesses to having been pregnant with Lapo's child—she lied to Irene that it was Giulia who was pregnant so that Martha could pretend to be Giulia and become the casualty of her mother's wrath. Giulia travels to her family's crypt and disembowels Martha's body to retrieve the deceased fetus. Giulia discovers that Irene has made arrangements with a mental asylum to take Giulia away and travels back to the estate. Before developing the reel of film from the day Martha died, Giulia interrogates and shoots Irene, finding the key to her childhood bedroom. Suddenly, bombs strike the estate and remove power to the house. Giulia comes to and revisits her childhood bedroom. She plays with her puppet theatre, recounting dismembering her mother and burying her body under a bridge. She visits her mother's grave, then returns to the estate to find power has returned. Giulia develops the reel and learns that she was the one who killed Martha, not her mother. She's ambushed by soldiers from the Italian resistance and tortured alongside her father, Erich, who is killed. Now alone, Giulia returns to the darkroom and plays a recording of her mother's confession, which reveals that Martha does not exist as Giulia's twin sister—rather, Giulia is an alternate personality of Martha. She plays with her puppet theater once more, walking through her rough upbringing in which Irene's abusive parenting caused a split in Martha's personality: a quiet, beloved Martha and troublesome, loathed Giulia. In the present, Giulia calls the town's priest, who convinces her to come to the church, where staff from the mental asylum finally take her away. In her headspace, Giulia talks to an alternate ego of herself and considers what events were fact and which were fiction. Regardless of the player's choices for her responses, the sequence ends with Giulia slitting her forearms. In her narration, Giulia states that she has since recovered and can put the events of the past behind her. Martha Is Dead received ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic . The game was censored for its release on PlayStation consoles. The changes include removing interactivity from certain graphic scenes and removing references to masturbation. The game is uncut on all other platforms.",LKA,"February 24, 2022",PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Windows Xbox One Xbox Series X/S,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,mother; pregnant,family; father,asylum,body,,kill; killed; murder; murdered; torture; tortured,,,young,

Parasite Eve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_Eve_(video_game)," Parasite Eve is a 1998 role-playing video game developed and published by Square . The game is a sequel to the novel Parasite Eve , written by Hideaki Sena ; it is the first game in the Parasite Eve video game series. The story follows New York City police officer Aya Brea over a six-day span in 1997 as she attempts to stop the Eve, a woman who plans to destroy the human race through spontaneous human combustion . Players explore levels set in areas of New York while utilizing a pausable real-time combat system along with several role-playing elements. Parasite Eve was SquareSoft's first M-rated game, and the first major American and Japanese game development collaboration for the company. It was produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and directed by Takashi Tokita . Music for the title was composed by Yoko Shimomura who was widely acclaimed for her work to create an ""inorganic"" and ""emotionless"" soundtrack that saw two album releases. Parasite Eve received positive reviews; critics praised the graphics and gameplay, but found the overall game too linear and with little replay potential. The video game adaptation was part of a resurgence of popularity in Japanese horror sparked by the original book, and was released alongside a film adaptation and two manga comics; one based on the book, the other on the video game. The original title was followed by two video game sequels: Parasite Eve II in 1999 and The 3rd Birthday in 2010, and was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2010. The first two games, Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II , had shipped over 3 million copies worldwide by 2010. Like other role-playing video games made by Square for the PlayStation, Parasite Eve was made during a period that Peter Tieryas of Kotaku described as an ""experimental period"" where nearly every role-playing video game from the company had unique combat mechanics. Contemporary reviews from GameSpot and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine described the game as a hybrid of Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil . Parasite Eve ' s game's director, Takashi Tokita, described the game's style as a ""cinematic RPG"", with its look and feel strongly alluding to an interactive movie-like experience. Movement in the "" world map "" (which is a map of Manhattan ) is limited to specific destinations. Upon the player walking over a ""hot spot"", there's a chance of a random encounter . Enemies materialize and attack players on the same screen that they move Aya around on, with no battle mode or screen being used. In battle, the game uses a pausable real-time combat system with an Active Time Bar (ATB) that sets the amount of time that has to elapse until the player can take their next action. While waiting for her turn, the player character Aya can be moved around to dodge enemy attacks. Upon each turn, the player may choose between attacking with their equipped weapon by pressing the attack button, using Parasite Energy (PE) for defense, assistance, or attack, using items, changing a weapon or armor, or escaping the battle. If the player chooses to attack, the battle briefly pauses and a dome/sphere symbolizing the range of the weapon appears, allowing the player to target an enemy within range. PE recharges during battle but the more players use it, the slower it refills. When not in battle, the player has the option of altering the weapon and armor attributes and effects with tools and super-tools, which are limited in number. The player selects the ""tune-up"" option, choosing the weapon that will be altered and the weapon from which the attributes or effect will be taken. Weapons have many different properties, including special effects like ""acid"", which causes enemies to continuously take damage. One of the principal role-playing elements of the game is that experience-based levels are present. Each time the player's level increases, their attributes go up and Bonus Points (BP) are given. These points can be distributed to the ATB, item capacity, or attributes of a weapon or armor. Once the game is completed, a new game plus mode is available called ""EX game"". It is different from normal play in various aspects; the player has access to every item stored in the police station, the game begins with the final weapon and armor the player chose before ending the first game but returns to level one experience, and the bonus points (BP) given to the player at the end of the game are now available to use. The items, weapons and power-ups are more powerful, as are the enemies the player encounters. However, the biggest difference from the normal game is the addition of the Chrysler Building , a new location with 77 floors (containing mostly randomized content), leading to a final boss battle with Aya's older sister, Maya. Aya Brea , an NYPD rookie, attends an opera at Carnegie Hall with a date in New York City on December 24th , 1997. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts , except for Aya, her date, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya confronts Melissa onstage, and Melissa says that Aya's mitochondria need more time to develop. She flees backstage, with Aya giving chase. Backstage, Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve. The next day, on December 25th , Aya and her partner, Daniel Dollis, go to see a scientist at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Hans Klamp. He teaches them about mitochondria, but they do not find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park , and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses. While Manhattan is being evacuated, a Japanese scientist named Kunihiko Maeda manages to sneak into the city, witnessing a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo , with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after she was involved in a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an ""Ultimate Being"". The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory , Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital , where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes. The next day, Aya sees the orange mass of people from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has engineered special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve in another part of the museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty , where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria cause it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board. Aya, Daniel, his son Ben, and Maeda attend Carnegie Hall, where Aya's mitochondrial powers allow her to resonate with the audience members, their eyes ominously glowing. Aya notices an odd glow coming from the Chrysler Building , leading her to find the original Eve, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains that after a car crash injured Aya and killed Maya and their mother, Klamp gave Maya's cornea and kidneys to Aya and Melissa respectively, giving them both mitochondria, and he cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister for a while but Eve soon takes over and they both engage in battle. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya's, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself, and protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building after telling Maya to return home together. The video game Parasite Eve is based on the Japanese novel Parasite Eve released in 1995. Plot-wise, the video game serves as a sequel to the book, referencing various events therein while also stating that Mariko Anzai, the girl whom Eve had chosen to become her host in the novel, is Aya's biological mother. The game was produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and directed by Takashi Tokita of Square . Development lasted roughly two years, including the pre-planning phase. Sakaguchi created the story outline, not watching any movies so he would not be influenced by them. During the first six months of production, the game was to be set in Tokyo and act as a more direct sequel to the novel, but Sakaguchi suggested setting the game in New York City. The game was built on a modified version of the Final Fantasy VII game engine . In contrast to previous Square titles, the development team for Parasite Eve consisted of both Japanese and American staff members, with a large part of the production taking place in the United States. An additional team of thirty were based in Square's Hawaii studio. U.S. artists Steve Gray and Darnell Williams were in charge of most of the CG work. Different concepts for the game's opening were considered, including different designs for Aya and Melissa transforming into Eve on stage during the opera. Book author Hideaki Sena did not know the title's plot until it was completed, since the game was a collaboration between Square and his publisher. Aya Brea was created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and designed by Tetsuya Nomura . Aya was originally being designed by someone else, but the original sketches did not satisfy Sakaguchi, who had wanted a long-haired character like Aerith Gainsborough , a central character from Final Fantasy VII . At the time, he was creating another unspecified character for a different project who sported short hair: he got confused while designing them and accidentally combined the two designs, creating the then-current Aya. The original concept for her was to have her as strong, sexy and ""bewitching"". Her name was taken from Sakaguchi's daughter Aya. The names ""Daniel"" and ""Maeda"" were taken from members of staff. A video demo of Parasite Eve was displayed at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show , consisting of full motion video with no gameplay footage. Parasite Eve was released on March 29, 1998 in Japan for the PlayStation. Television ads featuring the full motion video present in the game were aired in the United States in the run-up to the game's 1998 release. In a shipping mixup, over two hundred copies of the game were shipped to Best Buy retailers a week before release. Parasite Eve was Square's first game to be rated Mature by the ESRB and the first to be released under the Square Electronic Arts joint-venture. The game was released in North America on September 10, 1998. Before The 3rd Birthday ' s release in 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura discussed the re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II . The release was being held up partly due to the series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena. The game was later released in both Japan and North America on the PlayStation Network in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2018, the game was included in the Japanese lineup of the PlayStation Classic . Yoko Shimomura composed the game's soundtrack including the main theme, ""Primal Eyes"". The ending vocal song, ""Somnia Memorias"", is performed by Shani Rigsbee. The score met with great critical acclaim, using influences from both opera and electronica . Shimomura stated that she tried to compose ""inorganic"" music for the game, what she described as ""something unique"" for the game. A separate Parasite Eve Remixes album was also released, containing 10 tracks remixed from the original game by various artists. The idea for the work came from a simple suggestion to Shimomura that the game's music be remixed rather than rearranged . ""Somnia Memorias"" was also included on the Square Vocal Collection in 2001. Yoko Shimomura would later become a well-established video game composer through her work on the Kingdom Hearts series. Additional arrangements were done by Shigeo Tamaru . Despite her previous work as lead composer on Super Mario RPG , Parasite Eve became her breakout project and garnered her international fame. During her work on Parasite Eve , Shimomura spent time in America, which was where much of the game's staff came from. Because of this, Shimomura remembered the game as her most challenging project. She wanted the music to be experimental, not falling into ambient or techno classifications. One of her main goals was to create something ""inorganic"" and recognizable as a product of Square . Until Parasite Eve , Shimomura had written music in a straightforward manner that reflected her then-current state of mind, but this time she restrained herself and took a more ""emotionless"" approach. She felt that this would best represent the game's atmosphere and Aya's stoic attitude. Ultimately, she felt that Parasite Eve was an experimental work in many ways. Due to its prevalence in the story, Shimomura used opera music, but as typical opera music did not translate well into battle themes, Shimomura added different rhythms: these rhythms were inspired when some of the game's American staff took her to a nightclub and she heard the background music there. The music recording took place at the Andora Studios in Los Angeles . Parasite Eve was the first of her projects to include a vocal theme, the ending theme ""Somnia Memorias"". This was because the PlayStation system was the first to have sufficient processing power for this to be possible. For the vocalist, Shimomura avoided using someone well known. ""Somnia Memorias"" was sung by Shani Rigsbee , while the vocals for the orchestrated versions of ""Influence of Deep"" and ""Se il Mio Amore Sta Vincino"" were provided by Judith Siirila. ""Somnia Memorias"" was translated and adapted from Japanese into Latin by Raul Ferrando, while ""Se il Mio Amore Sta Vincino"" was translated by Daniella Spagnolo. The lyrics for all vocal pieces were written by Shimomura. The track ""I Hear a Voice Asking Me to Awaken"" was an arrangement of Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme , BWV 140 by Johann Sebastian Bach . The two-disc album Parasite Eve Original Soundtrack was released through DigiCube on May 21, 1998 under the catalog number SSCX-10020 . Later, due to popular demand from fans, a reprint was issued through the Square Enix label on January 26, 2011 under the catalog number SQEX-10222/3 . The music received generally positive reviews from music critics, and helped establish Shimomura as a popular composer with western video game fans. Parasite Eve Remixes is a ten-track album, featuring remixed versions of themes from Parasite Eve . The remixes were done by Shimomura, Tamaru, Hidenori Iwasaki and Keichi Takahashi. Multiple DJs also contributed, including Tomo, QUADRA, Dan K, Tribal Masters, Kay Nakayama, and Dummy Run. According to Shimomura, the album came about when someone suggested to her creating full remixes of themes rather than making simple rearrangements. Shimomura was in charge of extending and remixing ""Aya's Theme"", which was the main theme for Parasite Eve . The album was released through DigiCube on July 30, 1998 under the catalog number SSCX-10023 . Reviews of the album were mixed, with critics saying that it would not appeal to many and finding some of the remixes odd, repetitive or overly chaotic. According to Weekly Famitsu , 956,461 units of Parasite Eve were sold in Japan during the first half of 1998, which made it the country's third-best-selling game for the period. The game had shipped 1.94 million copies as of February 2004, with 1.05 million in Japan and 0.89 million in the rest of the world. In Japan, it was the 6th-top-selling game of 1998 with 994,000 copies sold. The game was re-released in North America under Sony's Greatest Hits label. Parasite Eve received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic . IGN praised the game for its beautiful graphics and cinematic sequences, as well as its mature tone, but noted, along with other reviewers, the game's linear plot structure. Game Informer cited the games ""exquisite"" backdrops but bemoaned its long load times each time players enter a new environment or engage an enemy. GameSpot said the game had a cinematic look, and had an ""astounding"" level of detail for real-life locations in New York City . The lack of any voice acting or singing, however, hindered dramatic scenes such as the opera and subsequent mass combustion of the entire audience at the game's start. The game was sometimes compared to the Resident Evil series, though GamePro said that Parasite Eve had deeper gameplay with multiple weapon upgrades and hidden areas to discover. Reviewers also cited that though the game broke many RPG gaming conventions, it suffered from having little replay value and being a relatively short game. The combat was compared unfavorably to Final Fantasy VII by Game Revolution , which featured a dynamic camera instead of fixed one. The novel's original author Hideaki Sena approved of the game, stating that he was ""actually impressed how well the game makers translated the novel."" The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Parasite Eve as a finalist for the ""Console Game of the Year"", "" Console Action Game of the Year "" and "" Console Role-Playing Game of the Year "" categories during the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards . In 2000, the game was ranked number 16 by the readers of Famitsu magazine in its top 100 PlayStation games of all time. In 2010, GamesRadar chose it as one of the ""Top 7... '90s games that need HD remakes "". In February 2011, Parasite Eve was announced to arrive on the North American PlayStation Network . It was released on March 15, 2011. The Parasite Eve video game was inspired by a popular Japanese original book, and was a part of the "" J-horror "" phenomena along with other fiction such as Ring , and led to two video game sequels and a manga adaptation based upon the video game universe called Parasite Eve DIVA . The 3rd Birthday executive producer and Square Enix executive Shinji Hashimoto revealed in 2017 that it was up to Tetsuya Nomura if the series would return. In an interview conducted by the pro wrestler Kenny Omega with The 3rd Birthday producer and Square Enix executive Yoshinori Kitase in March 2020, Kenny asked if there's a potential for another PE game. Kitase replied by saying ""I don’t know of any plans right now, but it would be a waste not to use these characters"".",Square,"JP : March 29, 1998 NA : September 10, 1998",PlayStation,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,birth; daughter; giving birth; giving birth to; labor; mother,wife,,body,escape; restrained,kill; killed,,evil; witch,girl,
Phantasmagoria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_%28video_game%29," Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click adventure horror video game designed by Roberta Williams for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows and released by Sierra On-Line on August 24, 1995. It tells the story of Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell), a writer who moves into a remote mansion and finds herself terrorized by supernatural forces. It was made at the peak of popularity for interactive movie games and features live-action actors and footage, both during cinematic scenes and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. It was noted for its violence and sexual content. Williams had long planned to design a horror game, but she waited eight years for software technology to improve before doing so. More than 200 people were involved in making Phantasmagoria , which was based on Williams's 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. The game was originally budgeted for $800,000, but it ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop and was filmed in a $1.5 million studio that Sierra built specifically for the game. The game was directed by Peter Maris and features a cast of twenty-five actors, all performing in front of a blue screen . Most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, while Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo- Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed that it was intended for adult audiences, and the company willingly submitted it to a ratings system and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content. Phantasmagoria was released on seven discs after multiple delays, but it was a financial success, grossing $12 million in its opening weekend and becoming one of the bestselling games of 1995. Sierra strongly promoted the game. It received mixed reviews, earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone while being criticized for its slow pacing and easy puzzles. The game also drew controversy, particularly due to a rape scene. CompUSA and other retailers declined to carry it, religious organizations and politicians condemned it, and it was refused classification altogether in Australia. The sequel Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh was released in 1996, although Williams was not involved. Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click adventure game that features live-action actors and cinematic footage , both during scenes between the gameplay and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were at the peak of their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon . In this single-player game , the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who is always on the screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to ""talk to"" when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, and walk. The mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier Sierra On-Line games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can click to perform an action. Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it. The user interface is a screen surrounded by a stone border, with buttons and eight inventory slots along the bottom. Adrienne can only hold eight items at once, and each black slot can contain an image of an item that the user can click on to retrieve or use within the game. In the middle of the inventory slots is a ""P"" button that brings up an options screen, allowing the player to save or restore games, change the game screen to full- or half-size, control the volume, or switch between a censored version of the game and uncensored one, with more graphic content. A chapter gauge on this screen conveys how much progress remains in a given chapter. A fast-forward button, located above the options button, allows the user to skip past cinematic scenes. On the left side of the interface is a red skull button, which the user can click to receive hints. On the right side is a red button with a picture of a closed eye, which displays any inventory item that the user drags to the button. The display shows a close-up image that can be turned in multiple directions. Game designer Roberta Williams , co-founder of Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive so it would be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World , the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward. Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell) and her photographer husband Don Gordon (David Homb) along with her pet cat Spaz have just purchased a remote mansion off the coast of a small New England island previously owned by a famous 19th-century magician , Zoltan ""Carno"" Carnovasch ( Robert Miano ), whose five wives all died mysteriously. Adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home, but starts having nightmares immediately upon moving in. She is comforted by the loving and supportive Don. Adrienne explores the estate, making mysterious discoveries like strange music, warnings written on her computer, and ominous messages from a fortune-teller automaton . Unbeknownst to the happy couple, Carno had practiced black magic when he lived in the mansion and had summoned an evil demon that possessed him and caused him to murder his wives. During her exploration of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases the demon that possessed Carno, which then possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly towards Adrienne and drinking heavily, culminating in him assaulting her later on. Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus ( Steven W. Bailey ), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion, though Don disapproves. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone-line, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him to stay away from his wife. Spaz also goes missing with Adrienne later discovering Spaz's collar where Don had been sitting by the fireplace earlier. While the local townspeople believe all Carno's wives died of natural causes or accidentally, (or left Carno), Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in grotesque ways; Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, (especially after the death of their daughter, Sofia, who drowned in the castle pond, suspecting Carno himself to have been responsible), was stabbed with gardening tools and then suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic , was killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and then her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) was force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she choked to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, in which she vomits a green ectoplasm that takes the form of Carno. A repentant Carno tells her that he was possessed by the demon when he tried to learn black magic to use in his performances. He reveals that the previously trapped demon must be stopped and only she can contain it once again. Adrienne is later horrified to discover Spaz's dead body in the garden. Adrienne visits the nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow ( Douglas Seale ), who is being cared for by Ethel ( Lilyan Chauvin ); Malcolm had been Carno's apprentice as a young boy and reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), who was tired of being abused by him, discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her secret lover, Gaston ( Jeff Rector ), Carno's prop master, to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most dangerous escapology trick; ""The Throne Of Terror"", in which Carno donned a burning hood and escaped from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage left Carno horribly burned/disfigured and falling into a coma, assumed dead, but he astonishingly survived and then attacked Marie and Gaston, mutilating them both. After killing Marie by beheading her with the throne, Carno was then impaled by Gaston, before succumbing to his own wounds. Malcolm that reveals that it was he who had originally sealed the demon in the estate's chapel and also tells Adrienne about a ritual that can eradicate the demon. Later that night, Mike leaves the mansion, finally having completed installing the phone-line, but is then murdered by Don an axe. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides to leave with Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day Adrienne discovers she cannot leave the mansion and later finds a collection of photos of her in Don's darkroom which have her head cut off. She is confronted by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom when he tries to kill her and flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, which pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform the ritual to trap the demon once again. The game then ends with Adrienne walking out of the mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic . Phantasmagoria was a radically different game for Williams, who was best known for designing the family-friendly King's Quest fantasy adventure game series. Williams said she did not want to get typecast in a particular genre, adding: ""I felt I had more to offer than fairy stories. I wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions."" Although Phantasmagoria was her first horror game, Williams had created murder and crime stories in her earlier mystery games, Mystery House and the Laura Bow series . Williams was a fan of the horror genre, although she did not watch many horror films as a child after a traumatic experience watching Horrors of the Black Museum (1959) at a very young age. She began watching them again as a teen, and particularly enjoyed such films as Halloween (1978), and movies based on Stephen King novels, like Carrie and The Shining (1980). Williams cited the works of King and Edgar Allan Poe as the inspirations behind Phantasmagoria . Williams had wanted to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria , and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the computer game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player had to be able to empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s. Phantasmagoria was the first Sierra On-Line game script to be written like a film screenplay. During the writing stage, Williams was under pressure to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams , the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company to focus more on lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in Phantasmagoria . Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial, but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don. She felt the rest of the story ""would make no sense"" without the scene, but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from the game before production ended. The script numbered roughly 550 pages when completed, about four times the size of an average Hollywood screenplay. It also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes. In preparation for writing it, Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels, as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays. She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear. She immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading. She also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process. Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games, like the Laura Bow series and some of the King's Quest games. She said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne, although it was not purposeful: ""I think it just kind of naturally worked out that way."" Andy Hoyos, the game's art director and a horror aficionado, participated in brainstorming sessions and discussions with Williams during the writing stage. He conceived the ideas for most of the death scenes and tried to make each one different and original with what he called ""fresh approaches to murder."" Williams wanted to include more scenes with Adrienne and Don as a happy, normal couple, so that Don's transformation to evil would have greater impact. She proved unable to do so while also maintaining the correct pacing for the gameplay. Williams wrote Phantasmagoria with the mass market in mind, targeting casual players as well as die-hard computer game fans. To that end, she wrote the game in short chapters to break it into smaller, easier-to-play sections. Her targeted demographic for the game was ages 16 and older. She chose the title ""Phantasmagoria"" after reading the word in a reference book about the history of magic and magicians. The term refers to a 17th-century theatrical horror show in which ""spirits of the dead"" were revealed in a darkened theater by the use of a modified magic lantern . Andy Hoyos was the art director for Phantasmagoria , and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy were among the computer artists. It was the first computer game Prugh worked on. Mark Hood, a veteran Sierra programmer, and Mark Seibert served as Phantasmagoria project managers. Seibert called managing the project ""much more of a technical and managerial problem-solving job than I ever envisioned."" Unlike previous Sierra games, it also involved managing a great deal of outside resources, such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule. The game's three-dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics software. In creating the look of the game, Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of Tim Burton , and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting, sets and ""imaginative edge"" of Batman (1989). Other influences included the films Alien (1979) and Hellraiser (1987). Phantasmagoria was designed using the 3-D software package Alias. Hoyos started by designing the rooms, then created the furniture, and added textures and lighting. Once complete, the computer rendered final images of each room, which became the backgrounds for the game. While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures, Phantasmagoria had more than 1,000. The game developers realized early during development that the game could not be completed entirely in-house due to the large scope of the project, and required working with Hollywood agencies, actors and special effects houses, among others. This added further complexity to the game's development and design. Gerald B. Wolfe, the game's director of photography, spoke to the artists about how to set up the camera angles during filming to best accommodate the design of the rooms. Mannequins created in the computer substituted as stand-ins for the actors to help Wolfe position the shots. Most of the artists had never created computer-generated backgrounds for video-captured characters, and found it to be a challenging process. Seibert said bridging the gap between Hollywood and the software world was difficult at first, but after about four weeks of shooting, the two sides had ""come to a common language and had a greater understanding of the process."" Hoyos said the biggest difficulty in designing the look of the game was creating a definitive scale for the environment, and ensuring the objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism. Once the filming was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage had to be edited down to fit the actions of the game. The programming included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs to reduce the number of times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected. Twenty-five professional actors were cast in Phantasmagoria . Roberta Williams watched the audition tapes of all the roles, and was involved with Mark Seibert in picking the actors. The only actor that Seibert chose without Williams' input was Victoria Morsell as the protagonist, Adrienne Delaney. Williams had watched other audition tapes for the part and was not happy with any of the choices. While she was on vacation, Seibert watched Morsell's audition and immediately selected her for the part. Williams was initially concerned that she was not involved in the decision, but later came to agree that Morsell was the correct choice. Morsell mostly had television experience, but had also previously worked in film and theater roles. She had to work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, for three months to capture all her character's actions and movements. David Homb portrayed Adrienne's husband, Don Gordon. Morsell and Homb started dating in real life after filming. Robert Miano was cast as the villain Zoltan ""Carno"" Carnovasch. He had previously appeared in several films by Phantasmagoria director Peter Maris . The comic relief roles of Harriet and Cyrus were played by V. Joy Lee and Steven W. Bailey , respectively. Lee had mostly done theater work in the Atlanta and Seattle areas, along with appearing in some industrial films and an episode of Northern Exposure . Bailey had been an actor in Seattle for about three years, doing mostly stage work, as well as some commercials, television episodes, independent films, and industrial films for the United States Navy . Malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor Douglas Seale . Stella Stevens played the antiques store owner Lou Ann, Geoff Pryser played Bob the realtor, and Carl Neimic played phone technician Mike. Traci Clauson portrayed Marie, Carno's fifth and final wife. Phantasmagoria was Sierra's first game to use live actors integrated with computer-generated backgrounds. About 600 scenes were filmed for the game. The total filming took about four months, 12 hours a day, shooting six days a week. More than 200 people were ultimately involved in the making of the game. A total of $800,000 was originally budgeted for Phantasmagoria , but it ended up costing $4.5 million. The budget issues caused some friction between Roberta and Ken Williams. It was the first game made in a new filming studio built by Sierra in Oakhurst, California , the same location as Sierra's headquarters. It cost $1.5 million to build and was overseen by studio manager Bill Crow, who said, "" Phantasmagoria essentially started with the design and creation of the studio."" Sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage the shooting process, including software to digitize the video into the computer. Some of the software was built as the game was being made and as the need for new tools was being identified. Sierra wanted the game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a director with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris , whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated a great deal from the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen , and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro Vlahos 's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist. Due to the nature of filming for a computer game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood in such a way that his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall. Morsell found it challenging to film a scene near the end of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions. The chase scene at the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne throughout the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said ""we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax."" Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher , two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillan and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether. Despite a storyline running over a course of seven days, Adrienne wears the same wardrobe throughout the entire game: an orange shirt and black pants. Williams said this is because many of Adrienne's actions throughout the game can be repeated by the player over and over, making it difficult to change her wardrobe without it becoming ""a nightmare of shooting."" The only solutions she saw were to allow less decision-making by the player, or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes. Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game. An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen. None of the characters wear blue, purple, gray or any shade of green similar to the blue screen for that same reason. For Phantasmagoria' s special effects, Sierra sought the professional effects house The Character Shop, headed by senior creature maker Rick Lazzarini. The core special effects team for the game consisted of Lazzarini, Michael Esbin and Bill Zahn. Lazzarini said making Phantasmagoria was a much faster and more cooperative process than in the film industry. Due to the tight filming schedule, most effects had to be done in one shot with no cuts, so there was less margin for error. They created the effects for all the death scenes in the game, which included creating assorted body prostheses, burn makeup and what Lazzarini called ""gallons of fake blood,"" which was made of sugar, water and dye. Adrienne's head is split open by a swinging pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached to either side so it could be pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it. One scene involved a burning head, which was created by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax to make it look bumpy. Another special effect involved a spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose , water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes. Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User created the musical score for Phantasmagoria , with Neal Grandstaf providing additional music. Most of the music is a mixture of real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer. Themes for the music ranged from rock and roll to opera . The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating stingers as needed. For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry. The opening theme of the game features a neo- Gregorian chant , which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a ""pounce"" effect, creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria , when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings are used in the score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments. Phantasmagoria took more than two years to develop. Sierra officials said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: ""It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do."" The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet. The date was changed once more to August 3, before it was finally released in stores on August 24, 1995, the same day as the Microsoft 's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS , then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out at the same time as the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm . In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World , said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost , for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25 , 8 megabytes of RAM , 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster -compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95. Phantasmagoria was heavily advertised by Sierra in advance of its release, and the company touted it as its biggest game to date. It was Sierra's first computer game targeted to an adult audience. There was no legislated rating system for computer games in the United States in place, although one was being debated before the U.S. Senate at the time. Sierra was among several major software companies that voluntarily supported the ratings system designed by the Entertainment Software Rating Board , which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases. The game was given an ""M"" rating for ""mature"" audiences, meaning intended for audiences 17 or older. As a result, it carried a content warning on the box that said ""contains adult subject matter."" The game box prominently displayed this rating, as well as a warning on the back panel that the game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children. It also encouraged parents to review the material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors. Phantasmagoria also received mature ratings in Germany and the United Kingdom . The game itself includes a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs during the most violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed it was the first CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: ""There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line."" But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was ""unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old"" and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, ""the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are."" In October 1997, the first chapter of Phantasmagoria was included in the Roberta Williams Anthology, a limited-edition collection of 15 games created by Williams over 18 years. Phantasmagoria was made available for digital download on the website GOG.com starting in February 2010 for $9.99. Phantasmagoria quickly became the bestselling game in the United States, and was Sierra's bestselling computer game to date. It grossed $12,000,000 and sold 300,000 units during its first week-end of release, debuting at number four in PC Data ' s August 1995 list of top-selling computer games for MS-DOS and Windows. It followed MechWarrior 2 , Microsoft Flight Simulator and Myst . By September, it had reached number one on the list among computer games and ranked third among all computer software, following Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus! InterAction , a magazine published by Sierra On-Line, wrote that no other Sierra game topped game charts as quickly as Phantasmagoria did. By the end of December, it remained at number three among overall software, and number one among computer games, and by January it was estimated as many as 500,000 copies had been sold. According to Sierra On-Line, its global sales surpassed 600,000 units by March 1996. Phantasmagoria finished 1995 as the ninth bestselling game of the year according to an analysis by PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator , Myst and Command & Conquer , and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh , and jumped back up to seventh among bestselling computer software programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the bestseller charts, and more than one million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone. NPD Techworld , which tracked sales in the United States, reported 301,138 units sold of Phantasmagoria by December 2002. Phantasmagoria received mixed reviews. Vince Broady, executive editor of Multimedia World , said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest . Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a ""masterwork"" and ""as close as it gets to a film you control,"" although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it ""one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies."" The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some ""horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger -like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed."" Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it ""the most sophisticated computer game to date"" and ""a weird, wild, horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart."" Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced players, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual players than difficult games like The 7th Guest . A Billboard magazine review said Phantasmagoria ""lives up to the advanced billing"" and ""aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex."" USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and ""a much-needed change from normal fare,"" although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was ""an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming."" He also called the gameplay ""elegant in its simplicity."" San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation was pleased with the story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced players, since they would be able to finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for those who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, ""The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach."" Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game ""visually opulent and interesting"" with ""dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot,"" but also said he had to adjust to the ""gradual, contemplative pace."" Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: ""It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going,"" although he said ""precious little happens"" in the first few discs. Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo called the storyline of a couple buying a haunted mansion ""a cliché so familiar that it needs no explanation,"" but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne was too much of an exaggeratedly feminine ""girlie-type girl."" Overall, Dembo said the game ""achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game"" and was ""an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry."" Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria ""appears to deliver on its ambitious promises"" and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that ""would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks."" Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was ""hilariously bad"" and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with ""so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before."" Other reviews were more negative. GameSpot writer Jeff Sengstack said the expensive budget and long production history ""do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming."" He complimented the graphics and music, but considered ""[the game] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame."" Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like Cleopatra and Waterworld . He said the graphics were beautiful, but the game ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were ""ordinary, pixilated fare"" was ""odd and unflattering."" A one-star review in The Video Games Guide , published in 2013, ""now seems little more than a flawed, though ambitious, white elephant."" In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content for the end of the game. But he said it was ultimately ""less a bad game than a bad horror film"" and said the execution, ""although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices."" In a review of Phantasmagoria in Black Gate , Sue Granquist said ""The game's graphic violence (and I do mean 'graphic' – in some cases disturbingly so) and content also led to some controversy. Phantasmagoria was attacked by a number of people, refused to be carried by some retailers, and was outright banned altogether in Australia due to their censorship laws. Unsurprisingly, all of the red tape around the game just made horror fans crave it even more."" Phantasmagoria earned an Editor's Choice Award from PC Gamer , and a Golden Triad Award from Computer Game Review , whose editors later gave it their 1995 Best FMV of the Year prize. It was nominated for Best Adventure/Role-Playing Software in the annual Excellence in Software Awards competition, known in the game industry as ""The Codies,"" which are among the most prestigious honors in software development. It was also named Best Adventure Game of the Year by Games Magazine , Game of the Month by Windows Magazine , and was one of three nominees for PC/Computing ' s Game of the Year. Before Phantasmagoria was released, CompUSA , the nation's largest discount computer retailer, notified Sierra it would not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: ""Software comes out all the time. Some we buy, some we don't. This one we chose not to."" Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of Jefferies & Co. , a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, and that it could in fact help it generate publicity. He added that ""It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever."" Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, ""When you say you're not going to carry something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about."" Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: ""I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product."" Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria , but others like Walmart continued to carry it. As well as the graphic gore and violence, the rape scene in Phantasmagoria drew particular attention and objections from the game's critics. One major newspaper claimed Phantasmagoria ""makes a game of sexual violence."" Multiple parents' groups, religious organizations, community action committees and special interest groups called for a boycott, and sent letters to the Sierra offices in droves voicing objections to the game. Phantasmagoria was unable to be sold in Australia after being refused classification by Office of Film and Literature Classification (the R 18+ classification was not available for video games at the time). The Roberta Williams Anthology collection was also banned in Australia because it featured a one-chapter preview of the game. The governments of two other countries also banned Phantasmagoria . The game was spotlighted in U.S. Senate hearings debating regulation of content in the computer software industry, and there was talk that it could re-ignite the debate in Congress over whether to impose federally mandated ratings on computer software that stores would be required to enforce. Sierra found that Williams tended to garner extremely favorable press, even as Phantasmagoria got negative press, so the company began having her discuss the game in person. In response to the backlash, Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television, which she said often have more violent content than Phantasmagoria , in part because computer games are often regarded as children's entertainment rather than for adults. Williams said Phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like Doom and Mortal Kombat , and that unlike those games, Phantasmagoria is ""the good guy ... not going around shooting up people."" Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the company's vice president of sales, both expressed surprise at the reaction to the game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing, box warnings and censoring options. Cloutier said the company was essentially ""censoring ourselves."" Steven L. Kent of The Seattle Times said there were more violent games than Phantasmagoria , but that most video game violence appears in computer animations, and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live-action game, which elicits a stronger emotional response. In April 1998, three years after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under criticism for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant , which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell , Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad , and Lamar Alexander , the former governor of Tennessee , all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky , and Jonesboro, Arkansas , and the ""increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down in front of a computer screen."" Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: ""We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that."" The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California , Ohio and Texas . The commercial success of Phantasmagoria had a positive financial impact on Sierra On-Line. Before its release, the company's stock rose in July 1995, up $3.875 to $30.875, which Vince Turzo of Jeffries & Co attributed in part due to anticipation of Phantasmagoria . Sierra's stock continued to rise after it was released. The company closed on the NASDAQ stock market at $43.25 on September 8, 1995, translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months, which Turzo attributed partially to Phantasmagoria ' s success. For the quarter ending September 30, 1995, Sierra posted a profit of $3.26 million, compared to a loss of $850,000 in 1994. This improvement exceeded expectations in analysts' forecasts, and was thanks largely to Phantasmagoria sales. Williams returned to work on the King's Quest series after Phantasmagoria was completed. Sierra used the same technology and Hollywood techniques from Phantasmagoria to make The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (1995), another interactive movie adventure game. Williams later described Phantasmagoria as the game that best represented her career as a game designer. Due to its development delays, Phantasmagoria was released after other interactive movie games like Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon , so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that game subgenre as the other titles. Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said by the time it was finally released, ""computer games that incorporate video [were] becoming a common sight on the software store racks."" Sean Clark, a project leader at LucasArts , feared the success of Phantasmagoria would set a bad precedent in that software companies would think they need huge budgets and many discs to have a successful game, rather than focusing on quality. A Phantasmagoria sequel, Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh (1996), was released by Sierra a year after the original. It was written and designed by Lorelei Shannon , Roberta Williams' design partner on King's Quest VII . Williams was not involved with it, and the game featured a very different tone and completely different characters, with no direct connection to the storyline of the first game. Shannon said the original game was a haunted house story in the style of a ""late night creature feature,"" while her game has more science-fiction and fantasy horror elements, in the style of the works of Clive Barker and Tanith Lee . Roberta Williams said both she and her husband Ken enjoyed the sequel. A preview for A Puzzle of Flesh was included in the first CD of the original Phantasmagoria game. Ken Williams had wanted Roberta to work on a Phantasmagoria sequel immediately after the success of the first game, but she could not do so due to her obligations to King's Quest VIII . Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because players could sense the absence of Roberta's style. ""It's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten. Within a few pages, the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed, regardless of the quality of the work."" Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after A Puzzle of Flesh because of issues after Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996. Distribution was handled by Davidson & Associates , another CUC company, which primarily sold educational software. Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in Phantasmagoria and did not attempt to sell the sequel as aggressively as Sierra would have. He also claimed Jan Davidson, the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson, personally did not like the game and ""wanted it shut down."" Due to these sales challenges, Williams said ""there was no reason to make a third Phantasmagoria ."" Roberta Williams said she was asked by Sierra to make a third Phantasmagoria game, and that she said she would consider it, but it was not ultimately made. Williams said: Before I would even consider tackling a major project like that, though – and devoting a couple of years of my life to it – I would need a huge outpouring from all of those gamers out there that they would truly love to have another Phantas to play. If there is a big enough groundswell of support for another Phantasmagoria , and if Sierra hears it and begs me enough, I might consider it. — Roberta Williams",Sierra On-Line [ a ],"August 24, 1995 MS-DOS , Microsoft Windows NA : August 24, 1995 Sega Saturn JP : August 8, 1997",Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Sega Saturn,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,daughter; labor,family; husband; wife,trauma,body; disfigured; flesh,escape; escaped; locked,abused; assault; kill; killed; murder; murdered; rape; stabbed; torture; violence; violent,rape,creature; evil; witch,girl; student; teen; young,

Resident Evil 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_2_%282019_video_game%29," Resident Evil 2 is a 2019 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom . A remake of the 1998 game Resident Evil 2 , it was released for PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One in January 2019 and for Amazon Luna , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch in 2022. Versions for iOS , iPadOS , and macOS were released in December 2024. Players control the rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and the college student Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a zombie outbreak. Capcom considered remaking Resident Evil 2 following the release of the remake of the first Resident Evil in 2002, but the producer, Shinji Mikami , did not want to divert development from Resident Evil 4 (2005). Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018 . It was built on the RE Engine , which was also used for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard . Resident Evil 2 received acclaim for its presentation, gameplay and faithfulness to the original. It won the Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year and was nominated for the Game Award for Game of the Year . By August 2025, it had sold 15.8 million copies, becoming the best-selling Resident Evil game. It was followed by the remakes of Resident Evil 3 in 2020 and Resident Evil 4 in 2023. Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror third person shooter game – unlike the remake of the first game , which sought to update and improve the original experience, this remake reimagines the gameplay and story for modern audiences. The game is set in Raccoon City , a fictional mountain city in the Midwest , during a zombie apocalypse . Players choose from one of two characters, Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield . Their choice affects the weapons, areas, items, subplot, supporting characters  (Leon has Ada Wong , a mysterious federal agent investigating the Umbrella Corporation , and Claire has Sherry Birkin , the young daughter of an Umbrella executive being pursued by a monster) and the final boss . The player is able to freely explore the environment around them while scavenging for resources such as healing items, ammunition, and key items used to solve puzzles and advance the story. Due to the technical and graphical upgrades offered by the RE Engine, the environment is rendered in full 3D using photorealism, improving its appearance and allowing for the tank controls of the original version to be replaced with a more flexible control scheme similar to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard . The player can move in any direction, rotate the camera around their character, alternate between walking and sprinting, and move around while shooting (however, standing still while aiming will tighten the crosshair , improving the accuracy and power of gunshots). Many areas are dark, requiring use of a flashlight to see in and adding an element of horror. As the player explores, they encounter zombies and other hostile creatures that attack and attempt to kill them. The player is armed with various weapons – both Leon and Claire have their own handguns, their other weapons differ (Leon has a shotgun, magnum, and flamethrower, while Claire has a grenade launcher, submachine gun, and the ""Spark Shot"" stun gun). Knives and grenades, both regular and stun grenades can be found and used as sub-weapons – if an enemy pins the player, they can use a sub-weapon to push them off and save themselves from taking damage, albeit at the cost of decreased effectiveness. Zombies are much stronger than in the original, able to take more bullets before going down, get back up after being knocked down unless their head was blown off, and chase the player into different rooms. The damage model has been greatly improved, with enemies reacting to damage from gunshots in real-time and capable of having limbs blown off. Taking damage decreases the player's health, shown by a heart rate monitor in the inventory menu. If the player takes too much damage, they will die, forcing the player to restart from their last save point. Health items such as herbs and first aid spray cans can be used to heal. The player has an inventory with eight slots which they can use to store their items and equipment. The space available can be expanded by finding hip pouches. Items in the inventory can be examined in a 3D model viewer, often used to reveal the purpose of key items, combined with others to produce beneficial items, such as combining gunpowder to create ammunition or herbs to create stronger herbal blends, or discarded if they have served their purpose. Safe rooms cannot be entered by enemies and contain item boxes, which can store spare items to be retrieved later. Safe rooms also contain typewriters, which can be used to save the player's progress – unless playing on Hardcore difficulty, the ink ribbons have been removed, allowing the player to save as much as they want (though the number of saves is still tracked). The player frequently encounters the Tyrant, a mysterious B.O.W. developed to hunt down and kill survivors. The Tyrant cannot be killed, only momentarily brought down or stunned, and will follow the player throughout the environment except into safe rooms. This forces the player to incorporate stealth tactics to evade him as they search for puzzles and items required to progress. Both protagonists have a section where their supporting partner briefly becomes playable – Ada can use an EMF gun to hack and overload electronic devices, while Sherry can crouch to fit through small gaps and focuses more on stealth. Beating the game unlocks the ""2nd Run"" for the other protagonist, which remixes item locations and contains the true final boss and ending to the story. The remake adds difficulty modes - Assisted, Standard, and Hardcore - which determine the abundance of items, strength of enemies, and whether the game autosaves or requires ink ribbons to use typewriters. Both of the bonus modes, ""The 4th Survivor"" and ""The Tofu Survivor"", return – the former is unlocked after beating the 2nd Run and sees special agent Hunk attempt to go from the lower waterway of the sewers to a rescue helicopter outside the police station while battling through a large gauntlet of enemies. Beating it unlocks ""The Tofu Survivor"", which replaces Hunk with a block of tofu that only has knives – however, the remake adds characters to this mode, who have a unique item loadout. Completing specific in-game objectives, or ""Records"", will reward the player with concept art , 3D models of characters and items, or in some cases, special weapons with unlimited ammunition or durability. ""The Ghost Survivors"" is a free bonus mode that is available from the beginning, and focuses on a series of ""what-if"" scenarios – each scenario depicts an alternate timeline where a side character who dies in the main story survives, and the player can control them as they attempt to reach a specific area in a manner similar to ""The 4th Survivor"" – unlike that mode, however, ""The Ghost Survivors"" contains special zombie types, zombies with backpacks that can be looted after killing them, and resupply machines from which the player can choose one of three items to take. The modes contain a ""Training"" difficulty, which gives the player an increased starting inventory and the benefits of Assisted difficulty but does not track the player's completion time. ""The Ghost Survivors"" has its own set of Records separate from the main story, which unlock cosmetic hats the player can wear. While these have no effect on gameplay, one, the cat ears, grants infinite ammo. On the night of September 30, 1998 two months after the events of the Spencer Mansion Incident , rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy makes his way toward Raccoon City to start his first shift at the Raccoon City Police Department. At a gas station on the city outskirts, he meets Claire Redfield, who is looking for her brother, Chris Redfield . The gas station is suddenly overrun by zombies, as well as the rest of Raccoon City, after a strain of the T-virus contaminated the city's water supply. The two reach the police station but are forced to separate when a truck crashes and explodes, and later discover the station to be swarming with zombies. The player character finds an infected Lieutenant Marvin Branagh , who reveals a secret passage leading out of the station before later succumbing to his bite. While exploring the police station, the player character may also be pursued by the Tyrant, a humanoid bioweapon created and programmed by the Umbrella Corporation to eliminate everyone within the station. The player character eventually reaches the underground passage, where they are attacked by a mutated William Birkin , Umbrella's leading scientist, whom they fight off before escaping. In the parking garage, Leon is attacked by zombie dogs, but is saved by Ada Wong. Ada claims to be an FBI agent sent to retrieve an incriminating sample of the G-virus , the virus responsible for Birkin's mutation, which he developed with his wife and coworker Annette . Meanwhile, Claire finds paperwork revealing her brother had left Raccoon City weeks prior to investigate Umbrella overseas. She runs into a lost Sherry Birkin , the young daughter of William and Annette, and resolves to protect her. After investigating Umbrella, news reporter Ben Bertolucci is detained in a holding cell by the corrupt police chief and serial killer Brian Irons , who has been covering up Umbrella's activities. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant suddenly attacks them, killing the former. Leon and Ada flee and reach Robert Kendo 's gun shop, where they find Robert and his infected daughter Emma. Witnessing Robert put down his daughter before committing suicide, Leon decides to help Ada retrieve the G-virus sample to expose Umbrella's corruption. The two encounter Annette in the sewers, who shoots Leon in the back before escaping to Umbrella's underground lab, NEST, unwilling to give up the G-virus sample. Leon recovers; he and Ada kiss as they descend into NEST. Meanwhile, Sherry is abducted and taken to the Raccoon City Orphanage by Irons. William arrives and injects Irons with a ""G-embryo"", which bursts from Irons' stomach, killing him. He incapacitates Claire and deliberately infects Sherry, confident that her body will accept the G-virus and allow it to replicate. Finding Sherry and descending underground into NEST, Claire retrieves a vaccine for the G-virus, which Annette administers to her daughter. Meanwhile, Leon retrieves the G-virus sample and runs into Annette again, who outs Ada as a mercenary intending to sell the sample to the highest bidder. William kills Annette; Ada demands the sample from Leon at gunpoint, but is knocked off into the abyss below NEST, along with the sample, as the facility starts to self-destruct. Leon then defeats the mutated and deadlier ""Super Tyrant"" after Ada, having survived her fall, throws him a rocket launcher before departing. He, Claire, and Sherry escape on a train out of the facility, where they are attacked by William once more in his final mutated form. Fortunately, the train decouples and William is destroyed in the lab's destruction. As the three reach safety, Leon and Claire vow to continue their fight against Umbrella. In No Time to Mourn , the player controls Robert Kendo, the owner of gun shop Kendo. While Robert survived the initial fallout, he lost his will to live after both his wife and his daughter Emma succumbed to the T-virus. Robert is encountered briefly in Leon's campaign after Leon escapes the police station, putting down his daughter before committing suicide. In this alternate scenario, before Robert can pull the trigger on his shotgun, he receives a radio message from a longtime friend, who managed to call a rescue helicopter for them both to escape in. Bidding goodbye to his daughter, Robert reaches the helicopter in the sewers and escapes from Raccoon City unharmed. In Runaway , the player controls Katherine Warren, the mayor's daughter, who was invited to the orphanage by Chief Irons to see her boyfriend Ben, only to be attacked by Irons and killed. Her corpse can be found on a table in the director's room. In the alternate scenario, Katherine manages to grab a knife off the table and stab Irons in the throat, killing him. Taking the prison keys off his corpse, Katherine makes her way back to the police station, where she reaches Ben's cell and frees him. The two lovers then embrace each other in a hug, though their fate is left uncertain. In Forgotten Soldier , the player controls Ghost, a special ops agent who was killed by William Birkin after he mutated into G. In this alternate scenario, Ghost narrowly survives the encounter and makes his way to NEST to finish his mission in securing the G-Virus sample. Searching the facility moments before it self-destructs, he retrieves the G-Virus sample dropped after Ada's fall. Ghost manages to escape on a cable car and sets off for safety, but is then held at gunpoint by Ada, who takes the sample off him. Ghost's fate is left uncertain. In No Way Out , the player controls Daniel Cortini, a local sheriff who investigates the gas station following reports of cannibalistic murders in the area - he is killed by the first zombie the player encounters and turns soon after. In the alternate scenario, Daniel manages to overpower and kill the zombie but becomes trapped inside the station as it goes under siege. Fending off numerous waves of zombies, Daniel is eventually saved by Leon just as he is overpowered, and the two set off for Raccoon City in the same manner as the beginning of the game. Their fate is left uncertain, although it is implied that Cortini would take Claire's place in the story.  The original Resident Evil 2 was released for the PlayStation in 1998. Following the release of the 2002 remake of the first Resident Evil for the GameCube , Capcom considered a similar remake of Resident Evil 2 , but series creator Shinji Mikami did not want to divert development away from Resident Evil 4 . In August 2015, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi announced in a video that the remake had been approved and was in active development, ending the video with the phrase ""we do it"". No further details were released until Sony's E3 2018 press conference, when Capcom released the debut trailer and gameplay footage and removed ""Remake"" from the title. Hideki Kamiya , director of the original Resident Evil 2 , said that he had pushed Capcom to create a remake for years. Hirabayashi said the team was striving to capture the spirit of the original game, and that the team incorporated feedback received about Resident Evil 6 , a game he also produced. To meet modern expectations, the team altered some character designs to better match the more photorealistic setting; for example, Leon no longer wears large shoulder pads, which were added to distinguish his original, low-polygon model. Though they strove to make a ""modern, accessible"" game, they focused on horror over action, hoping to preserve a claustrophobic feel. The game uses the RE Engine , the same game engine used for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017), which allowed Capcom to modernize the gameplay. Producer Tsuyoshi Kanda acknowledged the difficulty of making zombies seem scary and threatening, as they had become ubiquitous in entertainment media since the release of the original Resident Evil in 1996. By removing the fixed camera angles, the team had to use different ways to conceal enemies, using elements such as room layout, lighting, and smoke. The new camera system affected the sound design, as it no longer made sense for sound to come from a fixed source. The faces of several character models are based on scans of real people - for example, Leon S. Kennedy is based on the model Eduard Badaluta, Claire Redfield is based on the model Jordan McEwen, and Marvin Branagh is based on the music producer Patrick Levar. The game features a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. Due to Capcom's decision to use non-union voice actors, the original game's actors did not reprise their roles. The game was censored in Japan. It received a ""CERO D"" rating, as well as an uncensored ""Z rating"". Before the game came out, a demo known as the 1-Shot Demo was released on January 11, 2019. The demo was released on all major platforms and had a hard time limit of 30 minutes, ending after the timer ran out. The demo sees the player in the beginning stages of the game as Leon Kennedy and ends with a cinematic trailer promoting the full release. The 1-Shot Demo received over 4.7 million downloads worldwide. Although players criticized the 30 minute timer, the same demo would eventually be released as the R.P.D. Demo without the timer (and a Nemesis easter egg to promote the upcoming Resident Evil 3 remake). Resident Evil 2 was released on PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One worldwide on January 25, 2019. It supports enhancements on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X , offering either 4K resolution or 60 frames per second . A collector's edition was made available for the console versions, featuring extras such as a Leon S. Kennedy figurine, a hardcover art book, a R.P.D. renovation poster, and a digital soundtrack. On December 12, 2019, a final update was introduced to the Resident Evil 2 remake where the protagonist of Resident Evil 3 , Jill Valentine , has written a letter to Kendo. This letter can be found at Kendo's gun shop right after Leon and Ada escape from the police station. Reading this letter also unlocks an achievement called ""Chasing Jill"". Versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were announced on March 2, 2022, and released digitally on June 13, 2022 alongside upgrades for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) and Resident Evil 3 (2020). These versions include visual enhancements including ray-tracing and high-framerate modes, with the PlayStation 5 version supporting haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Owners on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One can upgrade free, and a free upgrade patch for the Windows version was released simultaneously. A version for Amazon Luna was announced on May 26, 2022, and was subsequently released on June 9, 2022. A Nintendo Switch cloud version was released on November 11, 2022. Versions for iOS , iPadOS , and macOS were released on December 10, 2024. A spin-off game for arcade systems, Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot , was announced by Bandai Namco in 2025. Resident Evil 2 contains various downloadable content (DLC) packs. It includes five DLC costumes for Leon and Claire: Leon has a sheriff outfit and a noir outfit, while Claire has a military outfit, a noir outfit, and the motorcycle suit worn by Elza Walker, the protagonist of the original game's development build - the noir outfits allow the player to play using a black-and-white filter. There are also three different variations of the ""Samurai Edge"" handgun, based on the models used by Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker in the first Resident Evil game, which were also released - the Chris and Jill models were included as bonus for players who pre-ordered the game. Finally, the Original Ver. Soundtrack Swap , allowed the player to replace the soundtrack with the original. Later, on February 15, 2019, Capcom released the original models for Leon and Claire from the 1998 release as free DLC. A third bonus mode, The Ghost Survivors , features four bonus missions: ""No Time to Mourn"", ""Runaway"", ""Forgotten Soldier"", and ""No Way Out"". The mode centers around side characters who die in the main story, and depicts alternate, non-canon scenarios where they survive. ""No Time to Mourn"" (featuring gun shop owner Robert Kendo, who commits suicide after putting down his infected daughter), ""Runaway"" (Katherine Warren, the mayor's daughter who is normally murdered by Chief Irons), and ""Forgotten Soldier"" (Ghost, a special ops agent who survives G's assault) require the player to reach a destination as they make their way through waves of special enemies, while ""No Way Out"" (Sheriff Daniel Cortini, who is normally killed by a zombie at the beginning of the game), which is unlocked after completing the other three missions, requires the player to defeat a wave of a hundred zombies inside the gas station from the beginning of the game. Resident Evil 2 received ""universal acclaim"" for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, and ""generally favorable reviews"" for the Windows version from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic . OpenCritic reports that 97% of 205 critic reviews recommend the game, with critics praising its scariness, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. The consensus on the website states: "" Resident Evil 2 is a gold-standard for how to do a remake, combining the original's nostalgia with modernized and fresh gameplay to bring an awesome experience for players old and new. This may be the best Resident Evil game ever released."" Ben Reeves of Game Informer wrote that "" Resident Evil 2 not only looks great, it plays well, and it forces you into a series of dark encounters that are a total rush."" Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that it was ""a reminder of how beautifully crafted survival horror games were in their heyday."" The Daily Telegraph ' s Tom Hoggins described the game as a ""thrilling return to the legacy of the 1998 original"". IGN ' s Daemon Hatfield originally gave the game an 8.8 in their review, increasing it to a 9.0 after being made aware of the unlockable second playthrough that presents the story from another point of view. He stated in his review that ""Capcom did a fantastic job of resurrecting all the best parts of the classic Resident Evil 2 and making it look, sound, and play like a 2019 game."" Chris Carter of Destructoid called the game ""A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage."" Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer described it as ""a masterly reimagining of a modern classic"". Polygon ' s Michael McWhertor wrote that Resident Evil 2 showcases ""the very best of survival horror""; similar praise was expressed by Heather Alexandra of Kotaku , who wrote that the game ""provides some of the best moments in the franchise"". Alessandro Fillari of GameSpot said that with Resident Evil 2 ""the classic survival horror franchise embraces its past in a new, exciting way"". Three million copies of Resident Evil 2 were shipped in its first week of release and four million in its first month, with more than one million on Windows. It became Capcom's second biggest launch on Steam after Monster Hunter: World from 2018. Resident Evil 2 debuted at number two on the Japanese charts with 252,848 retail sales, after Kingdom Hearts III .

Resident Evil 3: Nemesis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_3%3A_Nemesis," Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a 1999 survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom originally for the PlayStation . It is the third game in the Resident Evil series and takes place almost concurrently with the events of Resident Evil 2 . The player must control former elite agent Jill Valentine as she escapes from Raccoon City, which has been overrun by zombies. The game uses the same engine as its predecessors and features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Choices through the game affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with Resident Evil – Code: Veronica and was conceived as a spin-off featuring a different protagonist. It was designed to have a more action -oriented gameplay than its predecessors and features a larger number of enemies for the player to defeat. It also introduces Nemesis , a creature that periodically pursues the player throughout the game and that was inspired by the T-1000 Terminator from the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day . Resident Evil 3 received critical acclaim and sold more than three million copies worldwide. Critics praised the setting, detailed graphics and Nemesis as an intimidating villain, but some criticized its short length and story. In the years following its release on the PlayStation, Resident Evil 3 was ported to Windows , Dreamcast , and GameCube with varying degrees of critical success. In particular, the GameCube version was criticized for its relatively high retail price and outdated graphics. A remake , entitled Resident Evil 3 , was released in 2020. The fourth mainline installment, Resident Evil 4 was released in 2005. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror game where the player controls the protagonist, Jill Valentine , from a third-person perspective to interact with the environment and enemies. The player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance, the player explores a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space. The player can use a variety of firearms to defeat enemies, ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher . Aside from enemies, parts of the environment, such as explosive barrels, can be shot at, causing them to explode and damage nearby enemies. The game also introduces the ability for players to dodge attacks or perform a quick 180-degree turn to evade enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Health is regained with first aid sprays, as well as herbs, which can be used separately or mixed together to increase their healing effect. The game also features an ammunition creation system that allows players to create new ammunition from different varieties of gunpowder . In addition to engaging in combat, the player must often solve puzzles that focus on logical and conceptual challenges. During certain situations, the player will be put in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss . Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player until the end of the game. Once the player completes the game, a mode called The Mercenaries - Operation: Mad Jackal is unlocked. In this mode, the player must control mercenaries that Jill encounters during the main game and run from one side of the city to the other within a limited amount of time and resources. However, the starting time limit given is insufficient to actually perform this task directly, and the player must continuously receive time extensions by performing certain actions such as defeating enemies, rescuing civilians and exploring hidden areas. Depending on the rank received and difficulty chosen, completing the main game may unlock alternate costumes for Jill and epilogue files that detail the activities of different characters following the events of the game. The Mercenaries mode and alternate costumes for Jill do not need to be unlocked in the Windows and Dreamcast versions of the game. On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2 , former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member Jill Valentine attempts to escape from Raccoon City. Most of the population has been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus , the gruesome biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. After fighting through zombies and mutants on her way to the Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers , who is later killed by a new enemy. This creature, Nemesis-T Type, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target the surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, who had knowledge of Umbrella's experiments. After she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira , Mikhail Victor , and Nikolai Zinoviev . Nikolai explains to Jill that a rescue helicopter can be contacted if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower to ring the bell. When they are finished repairing a cable car, Nikolai goes missing and is presumed dead. Nemesis then corners the remaining members of the group onto the car as they head to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's central courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but she falls unconscious due to the T-virus infection given by Nemesis. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he finds a vaccine for Jill's T-virus infection in a nearby Umbrella owned hospital, then returns and administers it to her, saving her. After she regains consciousness on the morning of October 1, 1998, Jill proceeds towards the Raccoon Park to search for an escape route and enters the park caretaker's cabin. There, she runs into Nikolai, who reveals that he is a ""supervisor"" sent into Raccoon City to gather combat data on Umbrella's bioweapons. Nikolai retreats, and Jill later is confronted by the Gravedigger, a massive worm-like creature. Jill defeats it and escapes to an abandoned Umbrella factory at the edge of town through the worm’s tunnels. Inside the factory, Jill meets up with Carlos, who tells her that the U.S. government is planning to launch an experimental thermobaric missile into Raccoon City to eradicate the T-virus infestation. After confronting Nemesis and grabbing a keycard needed to escape, Jill learns that the missile attack on Raccoon City has begun, with only a short time left before the city is destroyed. Depending on the path taken by the player, Jill's final encounter with Nikolai will differ. In one version of the events, Nikolai will attempt to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be ambushed and killed by Nemesis. In another event, Nikolai will hijack Jill's intended escape chopper, and the player must either reason with Nikolai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nikolai, he reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping. Regardless of Nikolai's fate, Jill makes her way to the rear yard and confronts Nemesis again. After an intense battle, Jill defeats Nemesis with the help of a large prototype railgun before meeting up with Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape chopper was stolen by Nikolai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up with S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton , who helps them escape in his helicopter. At sunrise, the missile vaporizes Raccoon City, and Jill swears revenge on Umbrella. A newscast then briefly details the destruction and offers condolences for the lost lives. Resident Evil 3 was developed by Capcom and produced by Shinji Mikami , who had directed the original Resident Evil and produced Resident Evil 2 . After Resident Evil 2 was released, Capcom was working on multiple Resident Evil projects, with Hideki Kamiya directing what was planned to be the next main installment. This game would take place on a cruise ship and would involve HUNK attempting to bring back a sample of the G-Virus. However, Capcom cancelled the project after Sony announced the PlayStation 2 , claiming that its development would not be completed before the PlayStation 2's launch. Because Capcom did not want fans to wait years for a new Resident Evil on PlayStation , it promoted one of its side projects as the third main game while Kamiya's team moved onto Resident Evil 4 . The selected project was a spin-off developed by an inexperienced team led by director Kazuhiro Aoyama. It was intended to introduce a new character who would escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom made Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine the main character and decided that Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike the majority of the early scripts in the series, the story was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who had little experience with Resident Evil . Kawamura played the original game to familiarize himself with its fictional universe. The story was proofread and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other games, an issue that was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers. Resident Evil 3 uses the same game engine as its predecessors. The environments consist of 2D pre-rendered backgrounds while moving objects, such as enemies and some interactive elements, consist of 3D polygon graphics. The developers chose this technique because having full 3D graphics would not allow them to create graphically rich and detailed environments. According to project supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto , ""the number of polygons allocated for the enemies would not be sufficient. We did not want to have blocky, pixelated zombies."" Interaction with the environment was improved so that the player could shoot objects such as explosive barrels to damage enemies. The developers also added more zombie varieties, which can take the form of policemen, doctors, and ordinary citizens, among others. Unlike previous Resident Evil games, which mostly took place inside buildings, Resident Evil 3 takes place largely in the streets of Raccoon City. This allowed the developers to create more varied environments. Capcom introduced more action mechanics, which resulted in the addition of the 180-degree turn and a dodge feature to avoid attacks. Additionally, the developers designed the game so that up to nine enemies can appear at the same time, and improved their artificial intelligence to hunt the player up and down stairs. The Nemesis creature was inspired by the liquid-metal T-1000 from the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day . According to Mikami, ""I wanted to introduce a new kind of fear into the game, a persistent feeling of paranoia. The Nemesis brings that on in spades. When it disappears after the first confrontation, you live in constant dread of the next attack. The idea is to make you feel like you're being stalked."" The game was developed concurrently with the Dreamcast version of Resident Evil – Code: Veronica . It was originally referred to as Biohazard 1.9 or Biohazard 1.5 because it takes place between the first two Resident Evil games. Although Code: Veronica is set after Resident Evil 2 , Capcom wanted Nemesis to be the third numbered game to keep the PlayStation games consistent. Development began with a team of 20 people, but the size gradually increased to between 40 and 50 staff members. Unlike Resident Evil 2 , which features two discs with two different protagonists, Resident Evil 3 is a single-CD game that centers on Jill Valentine. Capcom chose her as the only protagonist because she was ""the only suitable character remaining"", noting that Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield had already been chosen for Code: Veronica . Resident Evil 3 was featured at the Tokyo Game Show in March 1999. A playable version was available at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1999. At the time, the dodging feature had not been completed and was absent from the demo. To promote the game, Capcom included a brief demo of Resident Evil 3 in the US shipments of their earlier game, Dino Crisis , which had a successful launch in Japan. Prior to the release of the game, Capcom spent US$20 million on advertisement campaigns for Resident Evil 3 and Dino Crisis , as well as the Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2 . The marketing campaign included dedicated television advertising, print advertising, and incentives to the consumer. A double soundtrack album , composed by Masami Ueda, Saori Maeda and Shusaku Uchiyama, was released on September 22, 1999. A novelization , Nemesis , written by S. D. Perry , was published in 2000. Resident Evil 3 was released for the PlayStation video game console on September 22, 1999 in Japan and November 11, 1999 in North America. The first 500,000 units of the game included additional demo discs of Dino Crisis . The game was a commercial hit, selling more than 1 million units worldwide by early October. According to NPD , Resident Evil 3 was the top-selling game for the PlayStation in the US during the first two weeks of November 1999. In Europe, the game was released on February 21, 2000 and became a bestseller in the UK, where it received a ""Gold"" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association , indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies. As of June 2012, a total of 3.5 million copies of the PlayStation version had been sold. Upon its release on the PlayStation console, Resident Evil 3 received ""universal acclaim"", according to Metacritic . GameSpot editor James Mielke considered it the most sophisticated and accomplished Resident Evil game in terms of graphics and gameplay. Official UK PlayStation Magazine called Resident Evil 3 ""a modern-day classic"", concluding that the game ""creates a believable environment, populates it with a host of evil adversaries and uses Raccoon City's urban sprawl to enhance the fiendish puzzles."" Computer and Video Games ( CVG ) remarked that the game preserves the best features of its predecessors and adds ""some exciting new elements"". Similarly, Edge described it as ""engrossing"", despite its similarity to its predecessors, and found the Mercenaries mode a valuable addition. The pre-rendered backgrounds were credited for their rich details and dark art style. According to IGN editor Doug Perry, ""Crashed cars, rubbish and rubble, totally destroyed city streets, and scattered broken glass and debris, all are housed in a suburban area that truly looks devastated in the worst possible way."" GameSpot felt that the 3D modeling of Jill Valentine was greatly improved compared to the ""blocky"" models in the original game. The music and sound effects received similar praise, with GamePro remarking that the game ""keeps the action hot by hiding what you shouldn't see, but telling you about it through the audio"". The introduction of the Nemesis creature was praised. Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the first encounter as shocking, while CVG said that the creature increases the tension level ""to an insane degree"" because the player never knows when he will appear. GameSpot praised the prompted choices during certain points in the game as they encourage replay value , but felt the game was too short compared to Resident Evil 2 , with only one disc and one protagonist. Perry praised the live-action-choice feature, stating that it ""speeds up the pace, increases the tension, and forces a decision that varies the following scene"". He found the 180-degree turn and dodge moves as welcome and necessary additions. In contrast, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine criticized the dodge feature as impractical and for relying too much on timing, resulting in doing more harm to the player. GameRevolution and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine criticized the simple premise and voice acting, while Next Generation said that the game might be a bit tiresome for players familiar with its predecessors. Resident Evil 3 was nominated for GameSpot ' s 1999 Adventure Game of the Year. Resident Evil 3 was ported to the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes than in the PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted that some of the pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in them looking not as good as the PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVG generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large. A GameCube version of the game was released in 2003 as part of an exclusivity agreement between Capcom and Nintendo . It received mixed reviews from critics and was mainly criticized for its relatively high retail price and outdated graphics. AllGame noted that the fact that the game was not priced as a budget title could mislead buyers into thinking that it was an enhanced update similar to the 2002 Resident Evil on the GameCube. GamePro remarked that, while the game's graphics on the GameCube were not like those of the 2002 Resident Evil or Resident Evil Zero , they were better-looking than previous versions of the game. As of November 2003, 41,395 copies of the GameCube version had been sold in the U.S. Resident Evil 3 was digitally released on the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2008 and North America in 2009, allowing PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable users to play the PlayStation version of the game via emulation . On June 26, 2024, Resident Evil was released on GOG.com , with Resident Evil 2 released on August 27, and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released on September 25. The titles were sold both individually and as a $24.99 bundle. The game will get enhanced 3D character models and higher-resolution graphics on its release. On August 19, 2025, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released on the PlayStation 4 and 5 platforms. A remake , entitled Resident Evil 3 , was released in 2020. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective and runs on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine . Although it features the same premise as the original game, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. Some features such as the original game's multiple endings, several locations and The Mercenaries - Operation: Mad Jackal mode were removed. The game received generally positive reviews from critics.

Resident Evil 4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4," Resident Evil 4 is a 2005 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom for the GameCube . Players control the special agent Leon S. Kennedy on a mission to rescue the president of the United States's daughter, Ashley Graham , who has been kidnapped by a religious cult in rural Spain. Leon fights hordes of enemies infected by a mind-controlling parasite and reunites with the spy and mercenary Ada Wong . In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower gameplay of previous Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 4 features a dynamic camera system and action -oriented gameplay. Development on Resident Evil 4 began for the PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first was directed by Hideki Kamiya , but series creator Shinji Mikami felt it was too great a departure from the previous games, so it was spun off as Devil May Cry (2001). Other versions were scrapped until Mikami took directorial duties for what became the final version. The game was announced as part of the Capcom Five , a collaboration between Capcom and Nintendo to create five exclusives for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 garnered acclaim for its story, gameplay, graphics, voice acting, and characters, and is cited as one of the best video games of all time , winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It was ported to numerous formats, and became a multi-platform hit, selling 14.7 million copies by March 2025. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the ""over-the-shoulder"" third-person view used in games such as Gears of War , Dead Space , and The Last of Us . Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009 and a remake of Resident Evil 4 was released in 2023. The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy , from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle . There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight . Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes . Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a ""finishing move"" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events , in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks. The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (""The Cattle"" in Spanish). They can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. Once simple farmers until becoming the product of an infestation of Las Plagas (""The Plague "" in Spanish), Los Ganados can gain the ability to cause mutated parasites to sprout from their heads. The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case , that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is ""Separate Ways"", a side story which focuses on Ada Wong 's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker . ""Ada's Report"", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigame ""The Mercenaries"" and short scenario ""Assignment Ada"" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser. In 2004, U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy ( Paul Mercier ) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham ( Carolyn Lawrence ), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult. He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain , where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas . While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera ( Rino Romano ), a former police officer in Madrid , and former Los Iluminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler ( Michael Gough ), leader of the cult, reveals his plan to use the parasite they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a ""sample"" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world. After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Iluminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps . Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas . He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar. Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser ( Jim Ward ), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping in an attempt to get close enough to Saddler to steal his new Plagas sample. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker ( Richard Waugh ), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample, though Krauser is suspicious of Ada. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her Jet Ski as the island explodes. In 1999, producer Shinji Mikami said a Resident Evil sequel was in development for PlayStation 2 . Resident Evil 4 underwent a lengthy development, during which at least four versions of the game were discarded. The first version was directed by Hideki Kamiya . Around the turn of the millennium, Resident Evil 2 writer Noboru Sugimura created a story for the game, based on Kamiya's idea to make a ""cool"" and ""stylish"" action game . The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of the protagonist, Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, with his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology . As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous installments and use a dynamic camera system . The team spent 11 days in the United Kingdom and Spain, photographing objects such as Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures . Though the developers tried to make the ""coolness"" theme fit into the world of Resident Evil , Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series' survival horror roots and gradually convinced the staff to make an independent game. This became a new Capcom franchise, Devil May Cry , released for the PlayStation 2 in August 2001. Development on Resident Evil 4 restarted at the end of 2001. The first announcement was made in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4 , the Capcom Five . This revision, commonly dubbed the ""fog version"", was directed by Hiroshi Shibata and was 40 percent finished at that time. The game saw Leon S. Kennedy struggling to survive after having infiltrated Umbrella's castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional Resident Evil monsters such as zombies . During the course of the new story which was again written by Sugimura's scenario creation company Flagship , Leon became infected with the Progenitor Virus and possessed a hidden power in his left hand. The producer of the final version also pointed out that Ashley did not appear back then, though there was a different girl who was never revealed to the public. The game was to feature some first-person elements. At E3 2003 , Capcom showcased a version widely known as the ""hook man version"". It was later titled Maboroshi no Biohazard 4 ( 幻の「バイオハザード4」 ; lit. ""The Phantom Biohazard 4"") on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD . During Mikami's introduction of the trailer , he assured that development was proceeding smoothly and claimed the game was scarier than ever before. The story was set in a haunted building where Leon contracted a bizarre disease and fought paranormal enemies, such as animated suits of armor , living dolls, and a ghostlike man armed with a large hook. The game had an otherworldly feel to it, containing elements like flashback and hallucinations that were marked by a bluish tint and a shaking camera. It also displayed various gameplay mechanics that carried over to the final release, like the over-the-shoulder camera, a laser sight for aiming in battles and quick time events. Other features, such as dialogue choices , were removed later. Five minutes of gameplay footage were released on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD , a Japanese pre-order bonus given out in January 2005. The Hallucination version had only a basic story concept, having dropped the previous scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said he was responsible for this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier ""and suggested using a particular scene from the American film Lost Souls (2000), where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [an abbreviation for ""Bio Organic Weapon"" in the series' lore] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive."" Kawamura added he was very sorry and ""even ashamed"" that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last cancelled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after a few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic. The story of the Progenitor Virus was eventually covered in Resident Evil 5 (2009) and the Spencer Estate became the setting for Resident Evil 5 ' s downloadable content (DLC) pack ""Lost in Nightmares"" (featuring Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine ). It was decided to reinvent the series. Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released. In an interview with Game Informer , Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to the feeling that the older system is ""more of the same"" after playing Resident Evil Zero . He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system. Speaking for the team, game producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi mentioned how the staff was ""tired of the same thing"" and how some got bored and moved on to other projects. In addition to that, the producer also felt that the older format was ""stuck in a cookie cutter mold"" and described it as ""shackles holding us down"". However, some of the staff members disagreed about changing the gameplay system. These members felt depressed and were hard to motivate after the game's focus shifted to be more action-oriented. Although Mikami demanded the camera system be revised, the team had reservations about making big changes to the series he had created. Eventually, he intervened, explained his proposed changes, and wrote a new story that, unlike previous installments, was not centered on the company Umbrella. Mikami wrote the entire story in just three weeks due to time constraints. Inspired by Onimusha 3: Demon Siege (2004), a game Mikami had enjoyed playing but felt could have been better with a different view, he decided to place the camera behind the playable character. To go along with the new gameplay and story, a new type of enemy called ""Ganado"" was created, as opposed to using the undead creatures from previous Resident Evil games. Furthermore, producers expended additional detail to modify and update characters that had previously appeared in the series. In a documentary explaining the conception of the characters, Kamiya stated he intended to make Leon Kennedy ""look tougher, but also cool"". Kobayashi was responsible for the design of some of the final game's enemies, such as the Regenerators. Kobayashi described the creatures' origins within universe lore as byproducts of Los Iluminados' research into bioorganic weapons, malformed creations implanted with multiple Plaga parasites during the experimentation process. Regenerators are designed to take distinct heavy breaths before they are seen, which alerts the player to their presence. When encountered, often in small confined spaces, they would walk slowly towards the player character. The Regenerator is capable of continuously regenerating itself and cannot easily be dispatched unless the player is able to find the Plaga parasites within its body, which can only be seen with the infrared scope , and specifically target them first. During an interview with Famitsu , Mikami explained that elements like the Regenerators help maintain the survival horror aspect of Resident Evil 4 as a balance between a ""scary kind of gameplay and the challenge of overcoming that fear"", with the goal of giving players a sense of achievement when they manage to overcome the monster. The English voice actors recorded their parts in four sessions, over three to four months. Capcom assigned Shinsaku Ohara as script translator and voice over coordinator. Carolyn Lawrence , who provided the voice for Ashley Graham, described her character as ""vulnerable, because Leon has to come to her rescue all the time"". She also described Kennedy's character as ""more brawn, perhaps, than brain"". In addition to the voice acting, the game's designer detailed each cinematic sequence so that each character's facial expressions matched the tone of their voice actor. Along with Resident Evil: Dead Aim and Resident Evil Outbreak (both 2003), two side story games that did not fall under the exclusive policy, it was announced on October 31, 2004, that Resident Evil 4 would come to the PlayStation 2 in 2005, citing increased profit, changing market conditions, and increased consumer satisfaction as the key reasons. The PlayStation 2 version included new features, primarily a new sub-game featuring Ada Wong. On February 1, 2006, Ubisoft announced that they would be publishing the game on the PC for Windows . On April 4, 2007, a Wii version was announced and was launched later in the year. The game features all of the extras in the PS2 version, along with other additions, including a trailer for Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles . The original version for the GameCube featured two different collector's editions. The first was available as a pre-order that included the game, the Prologue art book, and a T-shirt. GameStop offered another limited edition that was packaged in a tin box with the art book, a cel of Leon, and a soundtrack CD . Australia received an exclusive collector's edition that came with the game and a bonus disc with interviews and creator's footage. Nintendo handled marketing sales and distribution of the title in Europe and Australia. Resident Evil 4 was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo . It was released in North America on October 25, 2005. The largest addition is ""Separate Ways"", a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the Separate Ways campaign was something thought up by the PS2 porting team and was added after getting approval from Shinji Mikami. The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector's bundles from pre-orders. The standard package included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector's bundle also included a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box . This quickly sold out, and a second pressing was released that included an Ada figurine. Another, called the Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition , was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD , and a cel art of Ada. A PC port of Resident Evil 4 developed by Sourcenext was released in Hong Kong on February 1, 2007, published by Typhoon Games .

Games ' Adam Pavlacka and GameSpot ' s Kevin VanOrd acclaimed Capcom for adding great amounts of detail to the characters. IGN ' s Matt Casamassina went into further detail in his review for Resident Evil 4 , praising not only the detailed character design but also the fight choreography and three-dimensional modeling within cinematic sequences. Casamassina also complimented the voice actors, especially Paul Mercier (Leon), commenting, ""For once, the characters are believable because Capcom has hired competent actors to supply their voices. Leon in particular is very well produced"". IGN and Nintendo Power specifically recognized Resident Evil 4 ' s character design and voice acting. The increased variety of weapons has been praised by gaming publications such as GamePro and Game Over Online . G4 television program X-Play gave it a 5 out of 5, for introducing a new style of gameplay for the series as well as incorporating moments where the player would have to interact with the cut scenes. Not long after, it was awarded as the best game ever reviewed on the show. The makers of Resident Evil 4 worked on various innovations associated with the use and inventory of weapons. Game Over stated that players can use the vast array of weapons to ""go for headshots now"". Game Informer stated that ammunition is more plentiful in Resident Evil 4 than in other games in the series, making it more action-oriented. The ratings of the PC port, along with the Ultimate HD Edition release, were not as high as for the other versions. The original PC port was criticized for no mouse support and frustrating keyboard controls, low-quality FMV cutscenes , and choppy lightning graphics rendering. Despite these problems, it received generally positive reviews from critics, including IGN and GameSpot , which praised the gameplay, character models and environments, and sound design. GameRevolution referred to the game's Ultimate HD Edition as ""a bare-bones port of a nonetheless spectacular game"", noting ""minor superficial alterations"" similar to the 2007 PC port and asserting that the true ""Ultimate Edition"" of Resident Evil 4 is the Wii version. Japanese game magazine Famitsu reviewed the Wii version, with two editors giving it a perfect 10 score, and the remaining pair giving it a 9, resulting in a score of 38 out of 40. The reviewers felt that the new controls offer something fresh. Multiple reviewers agreed that even those who own the original will find something fun and enjoyable in this version. British magazine NGamer gave the Wii Edition a score of 96%, slightly lower than the 97% given to the GameCube version. They praised the visuals, controls, and features and commented on the fact that such an ""exceptional package"" was on sale for a low price; however, when writing about the Wii controls, they said, ""if you've played the GC version this won't be as special"". Official Nintendo Magazine gave the Wii version 94%, 3% less than the original due to it simply not having the same impact it did back then. In 2009, they went on to place the game 9th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time. IGN praised the Wii version, stating it is the superior edition, but does not push the Wii like it did with GameCube and PS2. GameSpot praised the new controls of the Wii Edition but commented on the lack of exclusive Wii features. Hyper ' s Jonti Davies commended Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition for its ""visual improvements"" but criticized it for having ""no new content"".

Resident Evil 4 is considered one of the best video games of all time . It is included in the reference book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die (2014). Nintendo Power ranked it as number one in their list of the top 25 best GameCube games of all time in 2005 and also ranked it second on their list of the best games of the 2000s in 2010. In 2008, Resident Evil 4 was ranked first place in the list of the best video games of all time according to the readers of IGN , and sixth place in the list of the best PlayStation 2 games of all time according to the IGN staff. In 2021, IGN ranked the game as the 40th best game of all time.

In 2007, Edge ranked the game at second place in its list of top games of all time, behind only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998). That same year, G4 named it the 21st top video game of all time, calling it ""a modern horror masterpiece."" In 2015, it placed 7th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In early 2006, in their 200th issue, Nintendo Power ranked it in second place in their Top 200 Games of all-time list, also behind only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time . In 2025, Rolling Stone named it the 27th-greatest game. Resident Evil 4 is regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s , particularly due to its influence in redefining the third-person shooter genre by introducing offset camera angles that do not obscure action. The new gameplay alterations and immersive style appealed to many not previously familiar with the series. The over-the-shoulder viewpoint introduced in Resident Evil 4 has later become standard in third-person shooters and action games, including titles ranging from Gears of War to Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009). It has also become a standard ""precision aim"" feature for third-person action games in general, with examples including Dead Space , Grand Theft Auto , Ratchet & Clank , Fallout , Uncharted , Mass Effect and The Last of Us . In 2019, Game Informer called Resident Evil 4 ""the most important third-person shooter ever"" and said it ""innovated two genres"", inspiring developers of both survival horror and shooter games . Resident Evil 4 redefined the survival horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay of the series with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill: Homecoming and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark . These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay. While working on The Last of Us , Naughty Dog took cues from Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action. Dead Space designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell stated that their game was originally intended to be System Shock 3 before the release of Resident Evil 4 inspired them to go back to the drawing board. BioShock (2007) was also influenced by Resident Evil 4 , including its approach to the environments, combat, and tools, its game design and tactical elements, its ""gameplay fuelled storytelling"" and inventory system, and its opening village level in terms of how it ""handled the sandbox nature of the combat"" and in terms of ""the environment."" Cory Barlog cited Resident Evil 4 as an influence on the God of War series, including God of War II (2007) and particularly God of War (2018), which was influenced by Resident Evil 4 ' s ""combination of poised camera exploration and scavenging"". Uncharted director Bruce Straley called the Resident Evil 4 village sequence the best opening fight in a video game. Resident Evil Village (2021) was influenced by Resident Evil 4. The director said, ""If Resident Evil 7 was like a reboot that inherited the DNA of the original Resident Evil , then you could say that this time we're doing the same for Resident Evil 4 . We've designed the game and its structure with Resident Evil 4 ' s essence in mind"". VentureBeat credits Resident Evil 4 HD as an early example of HD video game remasters . A remake of Resident Evil 4 was released on March 24, 2023, on the PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Windows , and the Xbox Series X and Series S . The remake was also announced for the iPhone 15 Pro , to be released between late 2023 to early 2024. In June 2021, the photographer and author Judy Juracek launched legal proceedings against Capcom for allegedly using images from her book Surfaces: Visual Research for Artists, Architects, and Designers (1996) without her permission to create textures for multiple games, including Resident Evil 4 and Devil May Cry . The parties reached an undisclosed settlement outside of court in February 2022. Capcom and Juracek have amicably resolved their dispute concerning the alleged use of her photos in Capcom's games. A dismissal was filed on February 7, 2022, with the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to end the lawsuit.",Capcom Production Studio 4 [ a ],"January 11, 2005 GameCube NA : January 11, 2005 JP : January 27, 2005 PAL : March 18, 2005 PlayStation 2 NA : October 25, 2005 EU : November 4, 2005 AU : November 9, 2005 JP : December 1, 2005 Windows AU : March 1, 2007 EU : March 2, 2007 NA : May 15, 2007 JP : June 7, 2007 WW : February 27, 2014 (HD) Wii JP : May 31, 2007 NA : June 19, 2007 EU : June 29, 2007 AU : July 5, 2007 iOS NA : July 27, 2009 JP : July 28, 2009 NA : April 3, 2010 (iPad) JP : May 21, 2010 (iPad) Zeebo BR : August 11, 2009 PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 JP : September 8, 2011 NA : September 20, 2011 EU : September 21, 2011 Android JP : January 23, 2013 WW : April 23, 2013 (Samsung) PlayStation 4 , Xbox One WW : August 30, 2016 Nintendo Switch WW : May 21, 2019 JP : May 23, 2019 Oculus Quest 2 WW : October 21, 2021",GameCube PlayStation 2 Windows Wii iOS Zeebo PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Android PlayStation 4 Xbox One Nintendo Switch Oculus Quest 2,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,daughter; labor,,asylum; hallucination,body; experimentation; infected; mutated; soul,abducted; captive; escape; held captive; kidnapped,kill; killed; rape; violent,rape,creature; evil; monster; witch,girl; young; young girl,
Resident Evil 5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_5," Resident Evil 5 is a 2009 third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom . It is a major installment in the Resident Evil series, and was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in March 2009 and for Windows in September 2009. It was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance agents Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar in Kijuju, a fictional region of West Africa . Chris learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, Albert Wesker , and his former partner, Jill Valentine . The gameplay of Resident Evil 5 is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay . It has also been considered the first game in the main series to depart from the survival horror genre, with critics saying it bore more resemblance to an action game . Motion capture was used for the cutscenes , and it was the first video game to use a virtual camera system . Several staff members from the original Resident Evil worked on Resident Evil 5 . The Windows version was developed by Mercenary Technology. Resident Evil 5 received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received divided opinions on whether aspects of it were racist ; an investigation by the British Board of Film Classification found the complaints were unsubstantiated. It is the best-selling game of the Resident Evil franchise when not including remakes, and the original version remained the best-selling individual Capcom release until March 2018, when it was outsold by Monster Hunter: World . A sequel, Resident Evil 6 , was released in 2012. In 2009, five years after the events of Resident Evil 4 , Chris Redfield , now an agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), is dispatched to Kijuju in West Africa. He and his new partner Sheva Alomar are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the Las Plagas parasite (those infected are called ""Majini"") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Sheva's mentor Captain Josh Stone . In Stone's data Chris sees a photograph of Jill Valentine , his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with Albert Wesker . Chris, Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded and masked figure. Irving leaves behind documents that lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields, where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW: a mutating troll-like giant. Sheva cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Jill is still alive, Chris does not report to headquarters and proceeds on their quest. Continuing through the marsh, they reunite with Stone and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by the Umbrella Corporation , as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Chris finds Jill's capsule, but it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a brainwashed Jill. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Chris and Sheva fight Jill, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she urges Chris to follow Wesker. Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Sheva keeps several. When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Chris and Sheva defeat. Jill radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a serum to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Sheva realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Chris and Sheva disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Jill and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Chris and Sheva fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Chris wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Sheva and Jill, he decides to live in a world without fear. Resident Evil 5 is a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as melee attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies. The game involves boss battles , many of which contain quick time events . As in its predecessor Resident Evil 4 , players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time. New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades, the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay. Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad . The game features puzzles, though fewer than previous titles. Resident Evil 5 is the first game in the Resident Evil series designed for two-player cooperative gameplay . The player controls Chris, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Sheva, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health , only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's storyline is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cutscenes. A version of the Mercenaries minigame , which debuted in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis , is included in Resident Evil 5 . This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit. Customized weapons cannot be used and players must search for weapons, ammunition, and time bonuses while fighting a barrage of enemies, to score as many points as possible within the time limit. The minigame multiplayer mode was initially offline only; a release-day patch needed to be downloaded to access the online multiplayer modes. Mercenaries is unlocked when the game's story mode has been completed. Resident Evil 5 was developed by Capcom and produced by Jun Takeuchi , who directed Onimusha: Warlords and produced Lost Planet: Extreme Condition . Keiji Inafune , promotional producer for Resident Evil 2 and executive producer of the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4 , supervised the project. Production began in 2005 and at its peak, over 100 people were working on the project. In February 2007, some members of Capcom's Clover Studio began working on Resident Evil 5 while others were working on Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles , which debuted for the Wii . Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original Resident Evil , directed Resident Evil 5 . He was one of several staff members who worked on the original game to be involved in Resident Evil 5 's development. The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda. Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in Resident Evil 4 , with ""thematic tastes"" from both Resident Evil 4 and the original Resident Evil . While previous Resident Evil games are mainly set at night, the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day. The decision for this was a combination of the game being set in Africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics. On the subject of changes to Jill and Chris's appearance, production director Yasuhiro Anpo explained that designers tried ""to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time"". Their new designs retained the character's signature colors; green for Chris and blue for Jill. Sheva was redesigned several times during production, though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of ""feminine attraction and the strength of a fighting woman"". The Majini were designed to be more violent than the ""Ganado"" enemies in Resident Evil 4 . The decision for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, for a new experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly on top of the second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at that time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision ""from a business perspective"", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made. Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's MT Framework engine and scenes were recorded by motion capture . It was the first video game to use a virtual camera system , which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors Reuben Langdon , Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Sheva, while Chris's voice was performed by Roger Craig Smith . Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Sheva, as Capcom were searching for someone who could handle the physical skills her motion capture required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day. All of the human character motions were based on motion capture, while the non-human characters in the game were animated by hand. Kota Suzuki was the game's principal composer and additional music was contributed by Hideki Okugawa, Akihiko Narita and Seiko Kobuchi. The electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music, recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles with the 103-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony . Other orchestral music and arrangements were by Wataru Hokoyama , who conducted the orchestra. Capcom recorded in Los Angeles because they wanted a Hollywood -style soundtrack to increase the game's cinematic value and global interest. Resident Evil 5 's soundtrack features an original theme song, titled ""Pray"", which was composed by Suzuki and sung by Oulimata Niang. Capcom announced Resident Evil 5 on July 20, 2005, and the company showed a brief trailer for the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) in July 2007. The full E3 trailer became available on the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store that same month. A new trailer debuted on Spike TV 's GameTrailers TV in May 2008, and on the GameTrailers website. A playable game demo was released in Japan on December 5, 2008, for the Xbox 360 , in North America and Europe for the Xbox 360 on January 26, 2009, and on February 2 for the PlayStation 3 . Worldwide downloads of the demo exceeded four million for the two consoles; over 1.8 million were downloaded between January 26 and January 29. In January 2009, D+PAD Magazine reported that Resident Evil 5 would be released with limited-edition Xbox 360 box art ; pictures of the limited-edition box claimed that it would allow two to sixteen players to play offline via System Link . Although Capcom said that their ""box art isn't lying"", the company did not provide details. Capcom soon issued another statement that the box-art information was incorrect, and System Link could support only two players. Microsoft released a limited-edition, red Xbox 360 Elite console which was sold with the game. The package included an exclusive Resident Evil theme for the Xbox 360 Dashboard and a download voucher for Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix from Xbox Live. Resident Evil 5 was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in March 2009, alongside a dedicated Game Space on PlayStation Home . The space, Resident Evil 5 ""Studio Lot"" ( Biohazard 5 ""Film Studio"" in Japan), had as its theme the in-game location of Kijuju. Its lounge offered Resident Evil 5 -related items for sale, events and full game-launching support. Some areas of the space were available only to owners of Resident Evil 5 . A Windows version was released in September 2009. This version, using Nvidia's 3D Vision technology through DirectX 10, includes more costumes and a new mode in the Mercenaries minigame. Resident Evil 5 was re-released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016, with a physical disc copy following in America that July. It was also released for Nintendo Switch on October 29, 2019. Shortly before the release of Resident Evil 5 , Capcom announced that a competitive multiplayer mode called Versus would be available for download in several weeks. Versus became available for download in Europe and North America on April 7, 2009, through the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. Versus has two online game types: ""Slayers"", a point-based game challenging players to kill Majini, and ""Survivors"", where players hunt each other while dodging and attacking Majini. Both modes can be played by two-player teams. The Windows version of Resident Evil 5 originally did not support downloadable content (DLC). During Sony 's press conference at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show Capcom announced that a special edition of the game, Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition , would be released in Japan for the PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2010. This edition supports the PlayStation Move accessory and includes a new scenario, ""Lost in Nightmares"", where Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine infiltrate one of Umbrella Corporation co-founder Oswell E. Spencer 's estates in 2006. Another special edition of the game, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition , was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America and Europe. Gold Edition includes ""Lost in Nightmares"" and another campaign -expansion episode, ""Desperate Escape"", where players control Josh Stone and Jill Valentine as they assist Chris and Sheva. The edition also includes the previously released Versus mode, four new costumes and an alternate Mercenaries mode with eight new playable characters, new items and maps. Like Alternative Edition , Gold Edition supports the PlayStation Move accessory with a patch released on September 14, 2010. The Xbox 360 version of Gold Edition came in a DVD with a token allowing free download of all DLC, while the PlayStation 3 version had all of the new content on a single Blu-ray disc. On November 5, 2012, Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition was placed on the PlayStation Network as a free download for PlayStation Plus users during that month. As part of the game's conversion to Steamworks , Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games for Windows – Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications , though Capcom later confirmed a way to work around these issues. In 2023, an update was released for the Windows version that removed Games for Windows – Live, thus restoring the split screen co-op feature to the game. Resident Evil 5 received generally favourable reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic . Reviewers praised the game's visuals and content. Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine complimented the game's fast pace, and called the graphics gorgeous. It was praised by Joe Juba and Matt Miller of Game Informer , who said that it had the best graphics of any game to date and that the music and voice acting helped bring the characters to life, and Brian Crecente of Kotaku said it was one of the most visually stunning games he had ever played. Adam Sessler of X-Play said the game's graphics were exceptional, and Edge praised the gameplay as exhilarating and frantic. For IGN , Ryan Geddes wrote that the game had a surprisingly high replay value , and GameZone 's Louis Bedigian said the game was ""worth playing through twice in one weekend"". While still giving favorable reviews of the game, several reviewers considered it to be a departure from the survival horror genre, a decision they lamented. Chris Hudak of GameRevolution considered the game to be a ""full-on action blockbuster"", and Brian Crecente said that about halfway through the game it ""dropp[ed] all pretense of being a survival horror title and unmask[ed] itself as an action shooter title"". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said the game ""morphs what was a survival horror adventure into a survival horror shooter"", and believed that this attempt to appeal to action gamers would upset some of the series' fans. Aspects of the game's control scheme were viewed negatively by critics. James Mielke of 1UP.com criticized several inconsistencies in the game, such as only being able to take cover from enemy fire in very specific areas. Mielke also criticized its controls, saying that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from (or quickly jump back from) enemies. Despite the problems he found it was ""still a very fun game"". Kristan Reed also had criticism of some controls, such as the speed at which 180-degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory. Joe Juba said that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed more ""like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension."" While praising some aspects of the AI control of Sheva, Ryan Geddes thought that it also had its annoyances, such as its tendency to recklessly expend ammunition and health supplies. Reception of the downloadable content was favorable. Steven Hopper of GameZone rated the ""Lost in Nightmares"" DLC eight out of ten, saying that despite the episode's brevity it had high replay value and the addition of new multiplayer elements made it a ""worthy investment for fans of the original game."" Samuel Claiborn of IGN rated the ""Desperate Escape"" DLC seven out of ten: ""Despite Desperate Escape's well-crafted action sequences, I actually found myself missing the unique vibe of Lost in Nightmares. The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn't particularly thrilling, and the one-liners, banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum."" Resident Evil 5 ' s 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village. According to Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal , ""There was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery"", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Sheva, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Sheva's character was added to address the issue of racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5 . He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were ""able to play the game and see what it is for themselves"". In a Computer and Video Games interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: ""We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business—we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way."" In Eurogamer 's February 2009 preview of Resident Evil 5 , Dan Whitehead expressed concern it might become a video game controversy , stating: ""It plays so blatantly into the old clichés of the dangerous ' dark continent ' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game was written in the 1920s"". Whitehead said that these issues became more ""outrageous and outdated"" as the game progressed and that the addition of the ""light-skinned"" Sheva just made the overall issue worse. Hilary Goldstein from IGN believed that the game was not deliberately racist, and though he did not personally find it offensive, he felt that others would due to the subjective nature of offensiveness. Chris Hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as ""stupid"". Karen Dyer, who is of Jamaican descent, also dismissed the claims. She said that in over a year of working on the game's development she never encountered anything racially insensitive, and would not have continued working there if she had. Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com said that despite the controversy the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent , whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations ""silly"", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an ""inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black"". It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed ""black men"" dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was ""not obviously black"". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, ""There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [and he] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa it is hardly surprising that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case, there is no issue around racism."" Writing for The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair considered Resident Evil 5 to be ""yet another moment in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter the most intimate spaces of European homes"". The authors state that Africa is presented from a Western gaze; ""what is presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience"". In 2016, Paul Martin from Games and Culture said that the theme of the game could be described as ""dark continent"", stating it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of ""Blackness"" reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race . The PlayStation 3 version of Resident Evil 5 was the top-selling game in Japan in the two weeks following its release, with 319,590 units sold. In March 2009, it became the fastest-selling game of the franchise in the United Kingdom, and the biggest Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game release in the country. By June 2025, Resident Evil 5 had sold 9.7 million units worldwide on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 with its original release. The Gold Edition had sold an additional 2.4 million units on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions sold another 3.7 million units combined, bringing the total sales to 15.8 million units. The original release of Resident Evil 5 was Capcom's best-selling individual edition of a game until March 2018, when Monster Hunter: World ' s sales reached 7.5 million units, compared to 7.3 million for Resident Evil 5 at the time. It was still the best-selling title in the Resident Evil franchise by far in 2018 with 10.6 million sales across all its editions; the second position at the time was held by Resident Evil 6 with 8.4 million. In May 2025, sales of Resident Evil 5 were at 15.5 million copies, though it was expected to be soon overtaken by the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 , which had 15.4 million sales at the time. Resident Evil 5 won the ""Award of Excellence"" at the 2009 Japan Game Awards . It was nominated for both Best Action/Adventure Game and Best Console Game at the 2008 Game Critics Awards , Best Action Game at the 2009 IGN Game of the Year Awards, and Best Sound Editing in Computer Entertainment at the 2010 Golden Reel Awards . It received five nominations at the 2010 Game Audio Network Guild Awards : Audio of the Year, Best Cinematic/Cut-Scene Audio, Best Dialogue, Best Original Vocal Song – Pop (for the theme song ""Pray"") and Best Use of Multi-Channel Surround in a Game. Karen Dyer's portrayal of Sheva Alomar was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance at the 13th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards , while the game itself garnered a nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction .",Capcom [ a ],"March 5, 2009 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 JP : March 5, 2009 AU : March 12, 2009 NA : March 13, 2009 EU : March 13, 2009 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Gold Edition JP : February 18, 2010 (PS3) NA : March 9, 2010 AU : March 11, 2010 EU : March 12, 2010 Windows JP : September 17, 2009 AU : September 17, 2009 NA : September 18, 2009 EU : September 18, 2009 Gold Edition WW : March 26, 2015 [ 3 ] Shield Android TV WW : May 19, 2016 PlayStation 4, Xbox One WW : June 28, 2016 Nintendo Switch WW : October 29, 2019",PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Windows Shield Android TV PlayStation 4 Xbox One Nintendo Switch,True,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,labor,,,infected,escape; locked,kill; killed; violent,,evil; monster; witch,teen,

Scarlet Hollow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Hollow," Scarlet Hollow is an episodic visual novel developed and published by Black Tabby Games. It entered early access on June 11, 2021 for Linux , MacOS , and Microsoft Windows systems. As of 2025, four episodes have been released out of a planned seven. Scarlet Hollow is a visual novel with RPG elements. The player chooses the protagonist's name, gender, and background, alongside two additional traits (out of seven options) that unlock unique choices and dialogue options. These traits are ""Book Smart"", ""Street Smart"", ""Talks to Animals"", ""Hot"", ""Keen Eye"", ""Powerful"", and ""Mystical"". There also exists a ""Hardcore Mode"" (unlockable as a New Game+ option) that allows the player to pick three traits, but at the cost of cutting out certain story paths those traits would normally grant access to. The player influences the story with their decisions and dialogue choices, though most basic story beats remain unchanged. Some options are labeled with the word ""(Explore)"", which in most cases means selecting them will not progress the story. Non-player characters ' perception of the protagonist is dependent on a hidden five-variable system (open/closed, agreeable/adversarial, insightful/dull, bold/passive, and reliable/unreliable) that shifts based on their responses. At certain points, the player may have the option to begin a romantic relationship with certain NPCs, though doing so will lock out other romance options for the remainder of the playthrough. The protagonist is invited to the funeral of their estranged Aunt Pearlanne by her daughter Tabitha, the new head of the once-affluent Scarlet family. They travel to Scarlet Hollow, North Carolina, a small town supported by the Scarlet-owned coal mines. The protagonist meets several residents including cryptozoology YouTuber Stella. She invites them to film a video with her in the woods. The two discover that fleshy creatures called “Ditchlings” have been abducting small animals and laying their eggs into them. The encounter can end with the death of local farmer Duke or Stella's pug Gretchen. The protagonist also encounters Sam Wayne, a seemingly supernatural man whose head is covered by a veil. On Day 2, the protagonist investigates the coal mines with Stella and her friend Kaneeka, potentially learning from the miners that Wayne is a former coal miner and Tabitha’s ex-boyfriend. As they leave, they spot town librarian Oscar’s daughter Rosalina sneaking into a condemned mine with her friends. Inside, Rosalina vents her frustration with Oscar moving her out of their house as he claims it is haunted. The protagonist has a vision of their ancestor Enoch Scarlet ignoring safety issues with the mine, resulting in a deadly mine collapse. Presently, ghostly creatures appear as the mine begins to collapse, and the protagonist is faced with helping Rosalina escape or going back to help her friends Becka and Alexis. On Day 3, the protagonist has dinner with Kaneeka and Stella’s friend Reese, a chronically ill young man who is mostly confined to his house. His mother Dr. Kelly cares for him and restricts his contact with the outside world, causing him to resent her. The group meets up at Oscar’s house and find it is haunted by the ghost of Charles Shaw Jr., the lover of the protagonist’s ancestor Edwardine Scarlet who was later killed by her. Charles demands that either Tabitha or the protagonist repay their family’s debt to him by sacrificing years of their own lives and becoming middle-aged. On Day 4, the miners have begun striking due to recent events. The protagonist secretly visits Reese and may discover that his mother has been poisoning him with ricin for years, causing his illnesses . Reese, off his “medication” and enraged by his mother’s deception, transforms into a beast. Dr. Kelly potentially reveals that Reese was conceived supernaturally and that she poisoned him as a means of suppressing his transformations. The encounter can end with Reese’s death, continued imprisonment, or escape. The protagonist is again visited by Wayne, who instructs them to investigate the Scarlet estate’s sealed-off wings. Scarlet Hollow is developed by Black Tabby Games, an independent game studio consisting solely of married couple Abby Howard and Tony Howard-Arias, originally founded in Boston before moving to Toronto . They ran a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in 2020 for the game. Scarlet Hollow ' s influences includes Life Is Strange , Twin Peaks , and Gravity Falls . Episode 1 was released as a demo in 2020, with Episode 2 releasing the following year. Following the release of Episode 3, the couple decided to release a second, non-episodic game that would support the remainder of the Scarlet Hollow . That game, Slay the Princess , released in 2023 and proved successful enough to fund the rest of Scarlet Hollow ' s development cycle. Episode 4 released in late 2022. An update expanding existing chapters of the game released in March 2025. Episode 5 will release on February 13, 2026. Reviewing Episode 1, PC Gamer ' s Emma Matthews praised the game's setting and implementation of the trait system. Rachel Weber of GamesRadar+ wrote positively of the game's hand-drawn art and dialogue, saying, ""The story has echoes of Shirley Jackson , with the snappy dialogue of a Netflix hit, and the art style holds it all together like a beautiful spiderweb spun with digital ink."" Writing for The Escapist , Amy Davidson praised the first episode's tone and pacing. CGMagazine scored the episode an 8/10 while focusing praise on the characters and setting. John Walker of Kotaku named the early access version of Scarlet Hollow as one of 2021's best games.

Scorn,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorn_(video_game),"Scorn is a 2022 survival horror adventure game developed by Ebb Software. Drawing on biopunk themes,  the game is inspired by the works of visual artists H. R. Giger and Zdzisław Beksiński . The game was released on 14 October 2022 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X/S . It was subsequently released for PlayStation 5 on October 3, 2023. The player controls an entity lost in a nightmarish world filled with grotesque creatures and techno-organic, living structures composed of machines, flesh, and bone. Over the course of the game, the player must explore different interconnected regions, fighting for survival, and gaining vague insights into the nature of the game's world. Gameplay is primarily split between exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. Puzzles are primarily based in experimentation and learning the nature of the many machines in the environment, such as repairing a complex transit system. For combat, the game presents various biomechanical weapons that all attach to a modular base: to utilize a specific weapon, the player character must remove the current weapon from the base and replace it with another. The game features four weapons: A melee weapon similar to a captive bolt pistol called a ""tool gun"" , which can also be used to interact with machinery at specific points; a pistol-like weapon, which can be used for accurate low-powered shots; a shotgun-like weapon, which has high damage at close range, but a low ammo capacity; and an implosive grenade launcher, mostly used for environmental destruction in the context of puzzles. Ammunition and health is deposited from limited-use storage stations. Health does not replenish on death, but can be replenished with a handheld device that is refilled. The story is set in an undetermined location apparently following a devastating war. The silent humanoid protagonist first awakens and attempts to cross a wasteland called The Field heading towards the looming citadel called The Crater seen in the distance before falling down a massive crevasse into a factory called the Assembly, a recycling plant that repurposes living things. While traversing the facility, the protagonist gradually acquires various weapons and tools which allow it to manipulate the facility's technology. Once it reaches the heart of the facility, the protagonist causes the heart's arteries to burst which knocks it unconscious and covers it with fluid. At this point, the protagonist seemingly faints while a being similar to the protagonist awakens and emerges from an egg-like shell structure elsewhere. The new protagonist makes its way to The Crater, which has seemingly been infested with hostile entities. In the Crater, the protagonist is attacked and infested by a parasite , which allows the protagonist to use several weapons and machines, but regularly wounds it and sprouts tendril-like appendages that gradually cover the protagonist's body. The infested protagonist reaches a central elevator that has been enveloped by a massive creature with a vaguely humanoid head called ""The Crater Queen"". Reactivating the elevator apparently kills the Queen but allows the protagonist access to a monorail to reach a temple called Polis. While the protagonist is exploring the temple, the parasite nearly fully envelops it, forcing it to use a machine to remove the parasite. During this process, it is heavily implied that the parasite is actually the first protagonist who mutated when the Assembly heart burst. Just before it is removed, the parasite disembowels the protagonist, who staggers to another medical device that connects it to an apparent hive mind within the temple. Controlling two androids called Shells, the second protagonist attempts to carry its own body towards a swirling energy field, but gets attacked and infected by the parasite before it can reach the field. With the parasite now merged with the protagonist, the two form a mass of seemingly immovable flesh. Scorn was developed by Serbian game development studio Ebb Software, founded in 2013. The developers claim to have designed the game around the idea of ""being thrown into the world"" , and as such, very little context is given about the game's setting. They also explained that they want the unsettling environment to be a character itself. The game director wanted to study the ""Space Jockey"" from the film Alien , the pilot of the crashed spaceship on planet LV-426. The technology and the living tissue all look as if it is part of one being; everything within the game abides by this idea of solid materials impregnated with organic growths. Scorn's world aesthetic was also inspired by the work of Zdzisław Beksiński . On the in-universe planet, the engineers, Homunculi , waged war against the two own split factions; one faction built cyborgs from bodies, while the other made militarized robotic exosuits. The game was announced on 12 November 2014, with a trailer showing pre-alpha footage, followed by a Kickstarter campaign in December 2014, which ended unsuccessfully;  despite this, the game remained in development with a planned two-part release. In January 2015, Scorn received private funding from an investor and full production started in February 2015. The game was planned to be released in two parts, with only the first part being announced as Dasein ( German pronunciation: [ˈdaːzaɪn] , a German word that means ""existence"" in vernacular German (German: da ""there""; sein ""to be""), and ""being-in-the-world"" in Martin Heidegger 's philosophy). In August 2018, the production team announced that they would launch the game as a whole, instead of in parts, although no concrete release date was announced. In 2017, Ebb Software launched a second Kickstarter, which reached its goal of €150,000 in September of that year. On 7 May 2020, it was announced that the game would be published on PC and have timed console exclusivity on Xbox Series X/S , running in 4K and 60fps, and would not be released on the previous generation of consoles as the developer team did not want to spend development time on what would be a sub-par version of the game. Scorn was also released on Steam , Windows Store , and GOG . On 9 November 2021, CEO and creative director Ljubomir Peklar posted a Kickstarter update to address the game's delays and lack of communication, suggesting that unsatisfied backers request a refund; the post was criticized by backers for its ""hostile tone"", for which Peklar later apologized. Scorn received "" mixed or average "" reviews, according to the review aggregator Metacritic . Though praised for its puzzles and art direction, Scorn faced frequent criticisms for its combat, which many reviewers felt was tedious and unnecessary. PC Gamer US described the game as a surreal horror adventure, and said: "" the striking visual feast of the alien capital, accompanied by mournful audio, practically moved me to tears. It was so strange and wonderful, and seemed to hint at some greater mystery at the heart of Scorn "". Conversely, they sometimes criticized unclear gameplay and the checkpoint system . Alessandro Barbosa of GameSpot praised Scorn for its interesting setting and aesthetic, but heavily critiqued it for its ""frustrating combat, unbalanced puzzles, and unforgiving checkpoints"", feeling they made the game ""an infuriating slog"". Writing for IGN , Leana Hafer described the game as ""a relentlessly unsettling delve into Hell with dreadful combat"", adding ""combat itself is dreadful, and I don't mean that in a good way"", though applauding its ""macabre art direction"" and puzzles. Hafer concluded Scorn would have been a better experience had most if not all of the combat been removed, feeling it ""[worked] against the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects"". Electronic Gaming Monthly ' s Michael Goroff echoed the combat complaints, believing it ""[felt] more annoying than tense"", but kept the game from ""feeling like a walking simulator "". Goroff commended the exploration and puzzle aspects working together with the overall horror tone of the game, saying ""everything in Scorn seems built around the simple desire of making players feel like they’re somewhere new"" and considered it to have captured the ""horrified and disturbed, exhilarated and intrigued"" experience of a nightmare.",Ebb Software,"Windows, Xbox Series X/S 14 October 2022 [ 1 ] PlayStation 5 3 October 2023",Microsoft Windows Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 5,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,,,,body; experimentation; flesh; infected; mutated,captive,kill,,creature,,
Senua's Saga: Hellblade II,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senua%27s_Saga%3A_Hellblade_II," Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is a 2024 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Xbox Game Studios . The game serves as the sequel to Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (2017) and is set in 9th century Iceland , drawing inspiration from Norse mythology and culture . Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was created with a higher budget and a larger team when compared with its predecessor. The gameplay is similar; it features combo-based combat, as well as puzzles . The gameplay and visuals have been revamped: faster-paced combat, and improved visuals built on Unreal Engine 5 , while retaining the psychological horror and focus on Senua's struggle with psychosis . Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was released for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. A PlayStation 5 version launched on August 12, 2025 alongside an ""Enhanced"" update across all platforms, including features such as a higher-framerate Performance Mode, new game modes and additions to Photo Mode. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its art direction, visuals and sound design, though some noted pacing issues and a combat system favoring spectacle over depth. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is a third-person action-adventure game. It carries over the concepts and gameplay elements of its predecessor, utilizing puzzles and runes to advance, and an examination of Senua's mental state. A new fighting system is also incorporated. The game features dynamic weather systems and realistic physics, affecting both combat and exploration. Players navigate treacherous terrain, from slippery ice-covered slopes to storm-lashed coastlines. The game features a revamped combat system emphasizing fluidity and strategy. Senua's expanded arsenal of moves allows for various combat styles and tactics, including a time-slowing mechanic for executing quick strikes. Enemy encounters boast a greater variety, each with unique attack patterns and weaknesses. The focus is on faster, more intense battles, requiring players to adapt quickly to different enemy types and utilize Senua's combat skills effectively to survive. Exploration is a significant aspect of gameplay, with players navigating landscapes and uncovering hidden collectibles that enrich the game's lore, such as hidden faces and Lorestangir posts. Puzzles in Senua's Saga are integrated into the environment, often requiring unique interactions with the game world, such as deciphering runes or manipulating elements to progress. The game features psychological horror elements. Players grapple with Senua's psychosis, and the voices that accompany Senua on her journey serve both as a guide and a challenge. In the 9th century, the Orcadian warrior Senua is willingly captured by Northmen slavers and taken across the sea from Orkney to Iceland, hoping to free her enslaved people. A storm destroys the slave ships and Senua washes up on shore. As she navigates along the coast, Senua experiences vivid hallucinations and is haunted by voices only she can hear that encourage or intimidate her, including the Shadow, the memory of her abusive father. Senua defeats the slave master, Thórgestr, taking him prisoner so he can lead her to his settlement of Borgarviki. Along the way, they encounter a razed settlement, which Thórgestr fearfully blames on the draugar , a legion of feral and cannibalistic barbarians. Senua follows the devastation to a Draugar camp and frees the captive Fargrímr, sensing his importance to her journey. The draugar are alerted and summon the giant Illtauga, who causes a rockslide which buries the camp. Senua and Fargrímr escape and return to the restrained Thórgestr, whom she decides to free because she senses good in him. The trio travel to Fargrímr's settlement which is on the brink of ruin due to Illtauga's attacks. Fargrímr explains that the Askja volcano eruption broke the walls between Midgard and Jötunheimr , allowing the giants into their world, and Borgarviki sacrifices slaves to appease the giants. Believing Senua is a seer because she hears voices, Fargrímr sends her to find the Hiddenfolk , god-like beings who live underground, who may know the giants' weakness. After passing tests to prove her worth, the Hiddenfolk tell Senua that Askja blackened the sky and blighted the land, causing famine, conflict, and the emergence of new, crueller gods. A desperate woman, Ingunn, left her infant in the Hiddenfolk's caves, hoping they would protect it and, in her anger, sought power from Asjka to survive, turning her into Illtauga. Senua confronts Illtauga with her true name and returns the bones of her infant, turning Illtauga to stone. Seeing her victory, Thórgestr resolves to join Senua's journey. Senua, Fargrímr, and Thórgestr travel to Baroarvik for resources, where their leader Ástríðr asks them to kill Sjávarrisi, the giant devastating their shores. The Hiddenfolk tell Senua that Sjávarrisi was a good man but, overcome by fear following Askja's eruption, he secured his safety by betraying Ástríðr's father into a fatal ambush. The settlers exiled Sjávarrisi and he was swallowed by the sea, becoming a giant. Draugar attack Baroarvik and although they are defeated, Senua blames herself for their arrival and the ensuing deaths. Senua and her allies lure Sjávarrisi from his cave, where Senua absolves him, turning him to stone. While traveling through the haunted Járnviðr forest on route to Borgarviki, Fargrímr, Thórgestr, and Ástríðr are stricken with fear and doubt, but Senua supports and leads them to safety. At Borgarviki, Ástríðr and Fargrímr free the restrained slave sacrifices left outside while Senua and Thórgestr confront his father and Borgarviki's leader, the goði . He refuses to listen to Thórgestr, and Senua deduces that the goði needs the giants because their threat allows him to maintain control over his people. Learning the slaves were freed, and with the giant Tyrant approaching, the goði captures Senua and attempts to sacrifice her, but Thórgestr confronts him. Senua is drawn away by the Hiddenfolk who reveal that Tyrant was a noble leader dedicated to protecting his followers following Askja's eruption. However, he was corrupted by the power they instilled in him and, when things improved, he gave them something new to fear by creating the giants and blaming them for natural disasters. Returned to reality, Senua witnesses the goði mortally wound Thórgestr. Before dying, Thórgestr warns Senua that if she kills the goði someone else will take his place. Senua defeats the goði, revealing his lies about the giants to his followers and turning them against him. She is tempted to kill the goði and take his place, becoming like her father and controlling her people to keep them safe at any cost, in turn receiving power, love, and fear. She relents, however, embracing the supportive memories of those she has saved and the realization that she is not bound by destiny. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was developed by Ninja Theory, the creators of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (2017). Ninja Theory was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 and became a subsidiary of Xbox Game Studios. While about twenty people contributed to Senua's Sacrifice , the studio has since expanded to employ around one hundred workers, with approximately eighty of them working on Senua's Saga . After the release of the first part, Tameem Antoniades, co-founder and creative director of the studio, decided to take a break and went on a trip, during which he visited Iceland . He was so impressed by the beauty of the place that it inspired him to have Iceland as the game's main setting. Attwell described the country as a ""geological theme park"", and Ninja Theory chairman Dom Matthews later called the game ""a love letter to Iceland."" Antoniades stated that the studio wanted to write a story that could be compared to ancient myths and sagas. Antoniades participated in the early stages of development before leaving the company. Following his departure, David Garcia, the director of sound, Mark Slater-Tunstill, and Dan Attwell, the director of environment art, took on the roles of primary project leaders. The creators wanted to shift the emphasis from portraying Senua's internal battle with insanity to examining how she interacts with the outside world, shaped by her unique worldview. To accurately depict psychosis in Senua, they once again consulted with Paul Fletcher, a professor at Cambridge University , and individuals experiencing the disorder. Melina Jürgens, the motion capture artist and voice actor for the protagonist, expressed her disapproval of the portrayal that her character had ""overcome all her adversity and healed."" She emphasized that individuals with psychosis typically never fully recover from their condition. Her intention was to depict Senua's transformation from a ""victim of psychosis"" to someone who can not only manage her condition but also utilize it as a tool to accomplish her objectives. Ninja Theory has described Senua as a ""beacon of hope"" in the sequel. To further embody Senua's character, Jürgens traveled to Iceland to experience the area's harsh climate firsthand. She studied martial arts and fencing techniques to develop a unique fighting style and recorded scenes while in full costume and makeup, a process that took almost eight hours to fully apply. Additionally, the animators underwent military training to accurately mimic the movements of opponent characters. Abby Greenland and Helen Golan reprised their roles as the Furies—the voices that Senua hears. Senua's Saga features an improved fighting system, emphasizing its ""seamless"" integration with the story. The primary inspiration for the battle system was the fight choreography featured in the "" Battle of the Bastards "" episode from Game of Thrones . To effectively portray Senua's struggle for survival, the developers focused on in-person combat, aiming to make it feel urgent, unpredictable, and immersive. They used motion capture technology to record a variety of battle animations over a 75-day period, covering different skirmish scenarios. Ninja Theory created an elaborate segment of the game before proceeding to full-scale development. Unlike the first game, which used Unreal Engine 4 , the sequel was developed using the newer Unreal Engine 5 . This upgrade allowed for improved character models, animations, and other visual components, as well as better utilization of the Xbox Series X/S console. On the Series X/S, the developers capped the frame rate at 30 frames per second to achieve a more cinematic experience. The studio employed Epic Games ' MetaHuman framework for facial animations. Motion capture was conducted in Ninja Theory's new office, which was specially equipped for this purpose. The developers collaborated again with 3Lateral, a subsidiary of Epic Games that specializes in motion capture digitization. 3Lateral contributor Uroš Sikimić stated that the team aimed to make the end result ""as photorealistic as possible, while also experimenting with new cinematic techniques"". Additionally, Ninja Theory partnered with Ziva Dynamics, a company specializing in visual effects, and Altered AI, which creates voiceovers using artificial intelligence. Altered AI's technology was used to generate content during the early stages of development. The developers then used satellite data in conjunction with the generated graphic resources to reconstruct the Icelandic landscape from the ninth century.  Numerous other components, such as hair and cosmetics, as well as clothes made by costume designers utilizing materials and methods unique to the era shown in Senua's Saga , were scanned to generate 3D reproductions using a similar process. Attwell claims that Robert Eggers ' directing techniques, namely his dedication to historical authenticity in the portrayal of diverse issues, served as an inspiration for the company. Similar to the prior experience, the creators replicated audio hallucinations using the binaural recording approach. The studio enlisted Heilung on the soundtrack, believing that ""their skill, depth and substantiveness in the music blends perfectly with our playing and gives it a special weight. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II was announced on 13 December 2019, during The Game Awards 2019 , where the debut trailer was showcased. It marked the first Xbox Series X/S console exclusive to be announced, coinciding with the unveiling of the console earlier that day. Senua's Saga was released on for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on 21 May 2024. The game is playable on the Xbox Cloud Gaming service and launched on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. It does not have a physical edition, and is similar in length to its predecessor. On the one-year anniversary of the game's launch in May 2025, Ninja Theory announced that Senua's Saga would release for PlayStation 5 in summer with new features added and optimizations for both the base console and the PlayStation 5 Pro . Enhancements available on both consoles include a Performance Mode that updates the game at a framerate of 60 frames-per-second (FPS), an additional roguelike game mode focused around resisting the Dark Rot during the main campaign, improvements to Photo Mode including support for in-game video capture, and a developer commentary. The PlayStation 5 version released on August 12, 2025, alongside a free update for the Windows and Xbox Series X/S versions with the aforementioned features. In addition to the standard edition of the game, Microsoft distributes a deluxe edition which bundles Senua's Saga with a native port of the original Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (2017) for PlayStation 5, containing the graphical and performance enhancements previously added to the Windows and Xbox Series X/S versions in 2021. An Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) listing in May 2025 revealed plans for Limited Run Games to distribute a physical release of Senua's Saga for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, alongside a similar release of the original Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice for Nintendo Switch . Senua's Saga: Hellblade II received ""generally favorable"" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic . Writing for IGN , Tristan Ogilvie describes Senua's Saga: Hellblade II as a ""six-hour tour across the human realm of Midgard"" with ""action sequences, stunning Nordic-inspired locations, and encounters with towering terrors."" The protagonist, Senua, portrayed by Melina Juergens, delivers a performance of determination to battle through fear and self-loathing. The environments vary from ""pits of blood and gristle"" to ""mountain treks beneath coral-colored skies and glimpses of aurora borealis."" IGN gave the game a score of 8, praising its ""heroine's journey,"" but noted that the combat system favors ""cinematic spectacle over gameplay depth."" Johnny Chiodini from Eurogamer praised Hellblade II for continuing Senua's story with ""grace, confidence, surprising brutality, and thundering conviction."" The review appreciated the shift in narrative focus from Senua's personal struggles to her interactions with others, stating that the game is less about battling mental illness and more about a person with a mental condition embarking on a significant journey. Eurogamer highlighted Senua's character development, noting her more compassionate self-view and her management of psychosis rather than battling it. GamesRadar+ described the game as ""haunting, confrontational, and deeply cathartic,"" commending its graphics and sound design for creating immersion. The review mentioned that the game's narrative structure adds depth between puzzles, and despite some pacing issues, it's a scarier, tighter, and more impressive sequel. Tom Bardwell from VideoGamer.com called Hellblade II ""bleak, distressing, and unmissable,"" praising its thematic explorations and visual delights. The review noted the game's cinematic quality, with transitions between gameplay and cutscenes, and felt the sound design complemented the game's heavy themes.",Ninja Theory,"Windows , Xbox Series X/S May 21, 2024 PlayStation 5 August 12, 2025",Windows Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 5,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,infant; labor,father,hallucination; mental illness; psychosis,body; illness; memories,captive; escape; prison; restrained,kill,,witch,,
Shadows of the Damned,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_of_the_Damned,"Shadows of the Damned is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It was directed by Massimo Guarini, produced by Shinji Mikami and written by Suda51 . The game follows Garcia Hotspur, a Mexican demon hunter who goes to the City of the Damned to battle its evils in order to save his girlfriend Paula, who was captured by the Lord of Demons, Fleming. The game is the result of a collaboration between Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami , and the combined styles of the two designers, namely the "" punk rock "" edge of the former and the "" psychological action thriller "" of the latter. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics, but sold extremely poorly. A remastered version of the game, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered , was released in October 2024 for Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Windows , Xbox One , and Xbox Series X/S . Shadows of the Damned is an action-adventure and third-person shooter video game. The player controls Garcia, moving him through the environments. Garcia's sidekick, Johnson, is ever-present, acting normally as a torch for light or quick melee attacks, but can become a weapon when needed. Johnson can take three forms: a pistol, a shotgun, and automatic rifle, all which are upgraded into more powerful forms either by finding blue gems left after boss fights that add extra abilities, or through slotting of red gems, found in the environment or purchasable from Christopher, to improve damage, reload speed, or ammo capacity. Garcia's health bar can also be extended using red gems. Health is restored by imbibing alcohol that can be found in the game's levels, or purchasable from Christopher or vending machines using white gems, the form of currency in the demon world. Johnson also can fire a special ""light bullet"", which can be used to both stun enemies and is a primary mechanic of the game's ""darkness"" puzzles. If Garcia enters an area covered by darkness, he will momentary be safe but soon the darkness will drain his health until he leaves or dissipates it. This most often can be done by firing a light bullet at a goat's head in the area, but often finding this goat requires completing other puzzles, such as opening a series of locked doors. Other ways of dispelling the darkness included killing demons that are spewing it, or using fireworks to temporarily remove it. In some puzzles, the solution can only be completed while Garcia is within the darkness. Demons that spawn from the darkness often will be shrouded by it even when the darkness is dispelled, preventing Garcia from damaging them until struck with a light bullet.  There are numerous boss fights that combine several aspects of the gameplay, including darkness, to be defeated. Certain levels are based on mini-games, such as the use of a sidescroller in some chapters. Demon hunter Garcia Hotspur comes home to find his girlfriend, Paula, being abducted by the Lord of Demons, Fleming, who brags that he will take Paula with him to kill her again and again. Garcia is powerless to stop Fleming, but instead follows him back to the underworld along with his demon sidekick, Johnson, who also acts as his gun, torch and motorcycle. In the demon world, Johnson helps guide Garcia through the twisted nature of the demon realm, defeating numerous enemies that try to feed on Garcia's flesh, and keeping him away from the darkness that destroys the human flesh. As they travel, they witness numerous deaths of Paula by Fleming and other demons, all to toy with Garcia's senses. Another human demon hunter, who simply goes by the name ""Colonel"", temporarily aids Garcia, but then leaves to get revenge on the death of his loved one, only to be brutally killed later. Garcia also encounters an ally in Christopher, a half-human, half-demon that sells Garcia valuable goods to boost his demon-fighting powers. Later in the game, Garcia and Johnson learn of the Unbreakable Huntress, the first female demon slayer to ever challenge Fleming. The Unbreakable Huntress challenged Fleming, but was brutally dismembered by the demon king. Impressed with her refusal to surrender even when reduced to a quad amputee, Fleming made the Huntress into his queen, only to repeatedly kill her over and over again, healing any wounds that resulted from the torture. In rebellion, the Unbreakable Huntress continued to escape from the City of the Damned, only to be dragged back and killed by Fleming. Paula is hinted to have been the Unbreakable Huntress prior to the start of the game. Eventually, Garcia reaches Fleming's ""Castle of Hassle"", and battles his way through to its top, where Fleming awaits him, Paula encased within his cloak.  Fleming enters into battle with Garcia, but Garcia gains the upper hand, and destroys him. He rushes to Paula's side, but she hits him, angered that he watched her die over and over and made no attempt to stop it or comfort her. Furious, she transforms into a demon herself, and attacks Garcia, but Garcia eventually weakens her enough. Paula reverts to her human form, and as she lies wounded and the darkness surrounds them, Garcia comforts her and apologizes. In the epilogue, Garcia and Paula have returned to his home and are planning for a trip, when Garcia receives a call from Fleming, warning him that more demons are coming for him. Garcia takes this in stride, commenting that as long as he is dating the Lord of Demon's mistress, demons will continue to follow them, and he vows to kill every last one. Shadows of the Damned marked the second collaboration between Japanese game designers Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami . They had previously partnered to work on the 2005 title Killer7 which Suda directed at Grasshopper Manufacture under the supervision of then Capcom game producer Mikami. Killer7 released to critical acclaim and expanded the public recognition of Suda's studio, which thereby began to explore opportunities for projects with mainstream appeal. Despite his team's prior experience of joint ventures with other companies, Suda sought to advance Grasshopper's financial success by the creation of internally produced games. Around 2006, he engaged the studio with the idea to develop a survival horror game titled Kurayami (暗闇, lit. ""Darkness""), conceived as an exclusive title for the PlayStation 3 . After Grasshopper committed to the game's development, Suda invited Mikami, who by then had departed from Capcom and established himself as an independent designer, to participate as producer. Kurayami originated from Suda's fascination with the works of Franz Kafka , specifically The Castle , whose narrative setting he hoped to recreate within the video game medium. In Suda's intended storyline for the game, the protagonist explored during nighttime a fantastical town surmounted by a large castle, which served as the point of destination for the player's journey. Although many hostile creatures populated the mostly unlit areas of the game's world, the player character wielded a torch which allowed him to illuminate and traverse those environments. Sources of danger for the game's protagonist extended beyond the enemy beings, as Suda wanted to enable interaction between the player and the town's ordinary residents from which confrontations could arise. Horror mangaka Q Hayashida provided enemy designs for the game. From this framework, Suda wanted to model Kurayami ' s aesthetics after the motif of ""darkness"", and hoped that the game would present the player with terrifying in-game scenarios by invoking ""our natural fear of the dark and the creeping discomfort we feel when things are quiet and lifeless"". To reinforce the visualization of those themes in the game, Suda planned to implement in Kurayami a specific variation of pixel shaders that would emphasize dark color tones of the game's graphics and mix textures with stylized effects. He credited this necessity as the impetus for his decision to develop the game for the PlayStation 3, as the platform's processing power aligned with Suda's expectations for the technology suited to deliver his envisioned visual technique. Suda pushed Grasshopper Manufacture to reinvent its accrued design practices from Killer7 for the creation of Kurayami in order to provide players with an innovative interactive experience; at the same time, he sought to carry over his established directorial style into the game. Comparing the game to Killer7 , Suda remarked that Kurayami employed an increased degree of player control over the protagonist and a greater focus on action-based sequences, features which he believed to be evidence of the gameplay's variability. The game's plotline was fashioned after a less linear template than that of Suda's past works, as he wanted to convey ""a thought-provoking message, not one that I just pick out of thin air once development work begins or some utopian nonsense about earth peace"". Whereas Suda mentioned that he had considered the idea for Kurayami extensively before the game's unveiling, at the time that the title was publicly revealed by Edge in May 2006, the development was in its earliest phase. By E3 2006, a publisher for Kurayami had not yet been established. In 2009, Suda revealed that his team did not work on the game over the preceding years due to their dense overall workload, and that the project's only assets comprised the designer's conceptual artwork that he showcased to Edge . Although at the time, Suda claimed that Grasshopper never decided to cancel Kurayami , the studio eventually abandoned the concept and restarted the production. Kurayami ultimately served the first incarnation of Shadows of the Damned . In 2008, Suda presented the game's concept to EA Games , who agreed to license the Unreal Engine 3 and to publish the game to a worldwide audience. Suda wanted to announce the game at E3 2009 , but was not allowed to do so, due to a media silence agreement between Grasshopper Manufacture and EA Games. That December, Akira Yamaoka (sound designer for the Silent Hill series) left Konami after finishing his work on Silent Hill: Shattered Memories and joined Grasshopper Manufacture because he enjoyed the latter's game No More Heroes . Yamaoka began work as the sound designer for the game. The game went about five different versions until Electronic Arts approved it. The newly titled Shadows of the Damned was finally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in 2010 as an action game. Shadows of the Damned took three years to make, and the game design had gone through significant changes (five design drafts in total). Originally, Garcia was going to start out shirtless and without a gun. From there, he would gradually acquire weapons along the way and purchase clothes at stores within the game. However, Grasshopper was pressured by EA to have Garcia start with a gun because ""westerners are about guns."" In addition, Paula was originally designed as a little girl living in Garcia's gun that would hop around like a rabbit or flutter like a butterfly when her ability is needed; and this would lead to a prominent love story. Again, EA had these features removed because they did not understand the concept. EA informed Grasshopper that ""there's this thing called an elevator pitch in America, and if you can't tell your story in the length of an elevator ride, Hollywood won't use it."" This forced Suda to completely scrap all of his initial ideas, with Johnson replacing Paula's role and the game becoming akin to a fairy tale, like Lupin the Third : The Castle of Cagliostro or Princess Peach and Mario . On July 17, 2012, Mikami expressed his disappointment and regret with Shadows of The Damned. He elaborated further in 2020 that Suda's original idea, which had more of an ""indie spirit,"" did not mesh well with EA's US$10 million budget. He said EA lied to them when they liked the original concept because later on, the publisher pressured them to change the game. [Shadows of The Damned] became a completely different game. That was a bit disappointing. I think Suda was unable to create the scenario he'd originally had in his head, and he rewrote the scenario several times. I think his heart was broken. He's such a unique creator, so it seems to me that he was not quite comfortable with making this game. — Shinji Mikami In 2019, Suda said the development of Shadows of the Damned was a huge challenge because as a habit of his, changing the game design meant he had to change the main character as well. He had to discard three character designs before settling with Garcia. He added that if he had to work with EA again on a new game, he would appreciate it if they would approve the first design draft the next time. In April 2024, Suda wanted to clarify that despite the shaky development, there was and is no animosity between him and EA. Shadows of the Damned received ""generally favorable reviews"" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. Destructoid said of the Xbox 360 version: ""This crackbrained horror romp takes camp to a new extreme and wants you, the player, to have nothing but fun the entire time."" GameSpot praised the game's sound design, challenging and terrifying bosses, varied gameplay, and clever use of darkness, but criticized the lack of a new game+ function as well as the stiff animation. GameZone said, ""To a much simpler degree, Shadows of the Damned is an amazing experience that anyone with a sense of humor and an affinity for rich games should get their hands on ASAP."" 1Up.com gave the game a C+ and concluded that the ""Creative story, presentation, and wonderful music provide the saving grace in doses, but almost all of your gameplay encounters can be summed up as average at best."" VideoGamer.com gave the game an 7 out of 10 praising the game's story and humor and concluded that "" Shadows of the Damned is easy to criticise, but it's got character - brimming with the stylishness of Suda 51 and the maturity of Mikami."" The A.V. Club gave the Xbox 360 version an A−, saying that ""Suda 51's warped, pop-culture-obsessed vision and Mikami's sure-fire action make a heck of a match."" The Guardian gave it four stars out of five and said, ""It's true that, at times, it feels a bit disjointed, the dialogue is occasionally annoyingly clunky and given that it has no online element, you could argue that it's hopelessly old-fashioned. But if you like the sort of gameplay that Resident Evil offers, it will bring you a lot of enjoyment, more or less from start to finish."" The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version a score of seven out of ten, saying that its ""erratic, slapdash nature leaves you slightly dazed. But despite some alarming dips in quality, despite the game never quite reaching the level of brilliance you hope for, you will be glad you played it."" The Digital Fix similarly gave the same console version seven out of ten, saying, ""The game is certainly the closest to a mainstream title that Suda 51 has been involved in. Strangely, the most memorable aspects of the game actually are quite distant from the actual gameplay; the characters, the storybooks and the music are more memorable than any of the action set-pieces. Having said that, the game is worth at least one playthrough, especially if you enjoyed any of Suda 51's previous titles."" Digital Spy gave the same console version three stars out of five and said it was ""not as scary as the likes of Silent Hill or Resident Evil , not as funny as No More Heroes and not as original as Killer7 , leaving it stuck in video game limbo."" The Escapist gave it a similar score of three stars out of five, saying that the game's ""slick visuals and offbeat sensibility is worth checking out, despite its ordinary gameplay. Besides, ordinary doesn't mean bad. Beheading demons with a shotgun that fires skulls has a certain amount of appeal, after all. It's pretty brainless, but it's a weekend's worth of stuff to shoot, and sometimes that's all you really need."" Edge gave the same console version a score of five out of ten, saying, ""With a little more restraint and focus on the core experience, Shadows Of The Damned could have been the action thrill ride Garcia Hotspur thinks it is. Instead the game – like Hotspur himself – is all talk."" Within a week of its release, Shadows of the Damned sold approximately 24,000 units in North America for the Xbox 360 and PS3 combined, as well as an additional 9,145 units in Japan on the PlayStation 3. The 2015 art book The Art of Grasshopper Manufacture heavily features art from the unused pitches for the game, including abandoned monster designs by Masahiro Ito , and explanations by Suda as to why EA refused Grasshopper Manufacture's plot and ideas four times. The 2013 videogame Black Knight Sword used plot points from the abandoned second direction for the game, most prominently the protagonist hanging himself at the start of the game, as seen in the art book, and the original dark fairy tale setting. Following Shadows of the Damned , Shinji Mikami  directed The Evil Within . The game features a mode titled ""Kurayami"" as part of its DLC. The mode is also built around light and darkness, which were important concepts in Kurayami . The two volume manga Kurayami Dance: Dance in the Dark , first published in 2015 and written by Suda 51, is partially based on the abandoned first direction for the game. A villain named G uses the first abandoned design for Garcia. The 2019 video game Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes features a level titled ""Damned Dark Knight"", a fictitious sequel to Shadows of the Damned . The level strongly comments on the game's troubled development, with Garcia and Johnson being NPCs. Additionally, a villain named Alfred uses the second abandoned design for Garcia, and the female lead of Kurayami Dance also appears in a visual novel segment of the game.",Grasshopper Manufacture,"PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 NA : June 21, 2011 AU : June 23, 2011 EU : June 24, 2011 JP : September 22, 2011 Switch, PS4, PS5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S WW : October 31, 2024",PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Windows Xbox One Xbox Series X/S,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,labor,,,flesh; memories,abducted; escape; locked,kill; killed; torture,forced,creature; evil; monster; witch,girl,

Silent Hill,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_%28video_game%29," Silent Hill is a 1999 survival horror video game developed by Team Silent , a group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo , and published by Konami for the PlayStation . It is the first installment in the Silent Hill video game series. The game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill. Stumbling upon a cult conducting a rite to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin. Five game endings are possible, depending on the actions taken by the player, including one joke ending. Unlike earlier survival horror games that used pre-rendering backgrounds , Silent Hill uses a third-person view with real-time rendering of 3D environments . To mitigate the limitations of the console hardware, developers used distance fog and darkness to obscure the graphics and omit pop-ins, which, in turn, helped establish the game's atmosphere and mystery. The player character of Silent Hill is an "" everyman "", unlike survival horror games focused on protagonists with combat training. Silent Hill received positive reviews from critics upon its release and was commercially successful. It is considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made , as well as a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away from the elements of the B movie horror genre to more psychological horror , emphasizing atmosphere. Various adaptations and expansions of Silent Hill have been released, including a 2001 visual novel , the 2006 feature film Silent Hill , and a 2009 reimagining of the game titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories . The game was followed by Silent Hill 2 in 2001 and a direct sequel, Silent Hill 3 , in 2003. A remake by Bloober Team is in development. The player's objective is to guide the main protagonist and player character, Harry Mason, through a monster-filled town as he searches for his lost daughter, Cheryl . Silent Hill 's gameplay consists of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The game uses a third-person view , with the camera occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect in pre-scripted areas. This approach differs from older survival horror games, which frequently shifted through various camera angles using pre-rendered backgrounds. Since Silent Hill has no heads-up display , the player must consult a separate menu to check Harry's "" health "" in similar traits of early Resident Evil titles. Harry confronts monsters in each area using both melee weapons and firearms. Being an ordinary man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience with firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected early in the game alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static , although players can choose to turn off the radio if they prefer. The player is encouraged to locate and collect maps of each area as soon as possible. These maps, stylistically similar to tourist maps, make navigating the game world easier. Accessible from the menu and readable only when sufficient light is present, each map is marked with places of interest. Visibility is mostly low due to fog and darkness; the latter is prevalent in the ""Otherworld"". The player finds a flashlight early in the game, which illuminates only a short distance. Like the radio, the player can choose to turn off the flashlight, making the game darker but causing monsters to have a more difficult time finding the player. Navigating through Silent Hill requires the player to find keys and solve puzzles. Silent Hill opens with a flashback, showing Harry Mason and his wife finding an abandoned child in a casket. The scene then shifts to Harry driving to the town of Silent Hill with his adopted daughter, Cheryl, for a vacation. Along the way, he notices a police officer driving toward the town, whose bike he later sees crashed on the side of the road. At the town's edge, he swerves to avoid hitting a girl on the road, which causes him to crash and lose consciousness. Upon waking up in town, Harry discovers that Cheryl is missing, and he sets out to look for her. Silent Hill is deserted and foggy, with snow falling out of season. He follows Cheryl through the fog and into an alley, where the environment suddenly darkens and he begins to discover gruesome remains. Harry goes deeper into the alley as reality shifts to a metallic, rusty environment and is eventually surrounded and seemingly killed by hostile creatures. He then wakes up inside a diner where he meets Cybil Bennett, the same police officer he saw earlier, who has come from a neighboring town to investigate the mysterious occurrences. She gives Harry a gun before leaving. Harry finds a clue that Cheryl is at the local school. While investigating, he is transported back to the ""Otherworld"" and has to defeat a creature before returning to the normal world. As Harry leaves the school, he hears bells ringing and follows the sound to an old church. There, he meets Dahlia Gillespie, a cultist, who gives him the Flauros, a charm she claims can counteract the darkness spreading through the town. Harry leaves the church and investigates the hospital, where he encounters its director, Dr. Michael Kaufmann, who is bewildered by the sudden changes in the town. Harry also discovers a frightened, amnesiac nurse named Lisa Garland hiding in one of the rooms. While investigating the hospital, Harry begins to question his own existence, wondering whether he is already dead and everything is happening in his mind. Harry asks Lisa to come with him, but she feels she must stay in the hospital. Harry meets Cybil again and comes to believe that a darkness is transforming the town into someone's nightmare, causing the inhabitants to disappear. Cybil suspects that Dahlia might be under the influence of drugs. Dahlia urges Harry to stop ""the demon"" responsible—the girl on the road who appears sporadically—or Cheryl will die. Continuing his search, Harry is drawn into a confrontation with Cybil, who has become host to a supernatural parasite; if the player collected the ""unknown liquid"" in the hospital, she can be saved, but otherwise Harry must kill her to proceed. The next time Harry sees the girl, the Flauros automatically activates and neutralizes her telekinetic powers. Dahlia appears and reveals that she manipulated Harry into capturing the girl—an apparition of her daughter, Alessa. Harry passes out. He awakens in the hospital, next to Lisa. Lisa explains that she experienced a sense of déjà vu while in the basement, and when he finds her again, she despairs that she is ""the same as them."" She pleads with Harry to save her and desperately grabs him, causing Harry to instinctively push her away as blood starts to run down her face; horrified, he flees. Blocking the door outside, he hears Lisa crying, prompting him to re-enter the room. Her diary is all that remains, revealing that she nursed Alessa during a secret, forced hospitalization. Alessa's never-healing wounds terrified her, and she fell deeper into a drug addiction fueled by Kaufmann. Finding Dahlia with Alessa's defeated apparition and charred body, Harry demands to know Cheryl's whereabouts. He learns that seven years earlier, Dahlia conducted a rite to force Alessa to birth the cult's deity. Alessa survived being immolated because her status as a vessel rendered her immortal, while her mental resistance to the rite caused her soul to be bisected, preventing the birth. One half manifested as the infant Cheryl, whom Harry and his wife adopted. Dahlia cast a spell to lure Cheryl back, while Alessa was imprisoned in the hospital, enduring unceasing agony from her injuries. With Alessa's plan thwarted and her soul rejoined, the deity is revived and possesses her. Five different endings are available, depending on the player's previous actions: Development of Silent Hill began in September 1996. The game was created by Team Silent , a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. Konami aimed to produce a game that would be successful in the United States, which led to a Hollywood-like atmosphere for Silent Hill . According to composer Akira Yamaoka , the developers were uncertain about how to proceed with the project. As time passed, both the personnel and management of Konami lost faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, the developers of Silent Hill had considerable artistic freedom, as the game was produced in an era of lower-budget 2D titles . Eventually, the development staff decided to disregard Konami's initial plan and instead create a game that would appeal to the emotions of players. To achieve this, the team introduced a ""fear of the unknown"" as a psychological type of horror . The plot was intentionally made vague and occasionally contradictory to leave its true meaning in the dark, encouraging players to reflect on unexplained elements. Director Keiichiro Toyama created the game's scenario, while programmer Hiroyuki Owaku wrote the text for the riddles. Toyama, who did not have much experience with horror movies, was influenced by UFOs, the occult, and the films of David Lynch , which affected the game's development. Toyama questioned Konami's decision to appoint him as director, as he had never directed a game before Silent Hill . The localization company Latina International translated the script into English. The town of Silent Hill is an interpretation of a small American community as imagined by the Japanese team, drawing inspiration from Western literature, films, and depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture . The game's joke ending was inspired by a suggestion box created to find alternative explanations for the events in Silent Hill. Artist Takayoshi Sato corrected inconsistencies in the plot and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially limited to basic tasks such as font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling . However, his contributions went uncredited, as he lacked the same level of respect within Konami as the more senior employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered and threatened to withhold his technical knowledge unless he was assigned to 3D work. His supervisor relented, allowing Sato to work on character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each character distinctive features but made Harry almost completely neutral to avoid imposing specific interpretations on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was challenging because Sato had no Caucasian co-workers to use as reference. Despite being largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters, his supervisor still hesitated to fully credit his work, intending to assign a visual supervisor to oversee him. To prevent this, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, using approximately 150 Unix -based computers to render scenes after his coworkers left for the day. Sato estimated that the game's budget was lower than that of Japan's biggest games at the time. He stated that the development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, opting for an engaging story that would endure over time, similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia , where presentations of movies and in-game scenes received applause from the audience. This favorable reception convinced Konami to allocate more personnel and public relations efforts to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan. The names and designs of some Silent Hill creatures and puzzles are based on books enjoyed by the character Alessa, including The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle and Lewis Carroll 's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . The game contains several real-life references, particularly in character names. Cheryl Mason's first name is based on actress Sheryl Lee , and Lisa Garland's surname is taken from actress Judy Garland . ""Michael Kaufmann"" combines the first name of Troma Studios producer Michael Herz and the surname of producer Lloyd Kaufmann. Alessa's original name was ""Asia"", and Dahlia's was ""Daria"", after actresses Asia Argento and Daria Nicolodi —Argento's mother. Harry's name was initially ""Humbert"", and Cheryl's was ""Dolores"", referencing the protagonist and title character of Vladimir Nabokov 's novel Lolita . The American staff altered these names, considering them too uncommon. Fictitious religious items in the game drew inspiration from various religions: the spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis is based on a similarly named herb in the Kabbalah ( Jewish mysticism ); the ""Seal of Metatron"" (also referred to by Dahlia as the ""Mark of Samael"") references the angels Metatron and Samael ; and the name ""Flauros"" was taken from a demon in the Lemegeton , a book of magic attributed to Solomon . Certain items and doors in the ""nowhere"" dimension were given names based on occult elements to symbolize magical traits of Dahlia. The names of these doors, taken from angels Ophiel , Hagith , Phaleg , and Bethor —who appear in medieval black magic texts—were used to signify deeper entry into Alessa's mind, according to Owaku. The soundtrack for Silent Hill was composed by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested to join the development team after the original musician left. In addition to the music, he was responsible for sound effect creation and audio mastering . Yamaoka did not watch game scenes but instead created the music independently from the visuals. His compositions were influenced by Angelo Badalamenti , the composer for Twin Peaks . To differentiate Silent Hill from other games and to give it a cold, rusty feel, Yamaoka chose industrial music . When he presented his compositions to the staff for the first time, they mistook the sound for a game bug . Yamaoka explained that the noise was intentional for the music, and the team only withdrew their objections after he elaborated on his reasons for this style. On March 5, 1999, the album Silent Hill Original Soundtracks was released in Japan. The 41st track, the ending theme ""Esperándote"", was composed by Rika Muranaka . After Yamaoka approached her to create a piece of music for the game, she suggested using bandoneóns , violins , and a Spanish-speaking singer. It was decided to make the song a tango , and Muranaka composed the melody for English lyrics she had conceived. When she arrived in Buenos Aires , Argentina , to record the translated Spanish lyrics with Argentine singer Vanesa Quiroz, Muranaka found that the syllables no longer matched the melody, and she had to recompose it in five minutes. On October 29, 2013, Perseverance Records released a ""Best Of"" album featuring 16 newly interpreted instrumental tracks composed by Akira Yamaoka and arranged and performed by Edgar Rothermich. The 17th track on the album is the ballad ""I Want Love"", performed by Romina Arena . Silent Hill was released for the PlayStation in 1999, with launch dates spanning from February to July in North America, Japan, and Europe. In 2006, it was included in the Silent Hill Complete Set in Japan. Silent Hill became available for download from the European PlayStation Network store for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable on March 19, 2009. However, two days later, the game was removed due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". On September 10, 2009, Silent Hill was released on the North American PlayStation Network. and it was re-released on the European PlayStation Network on October 26, 2011. A visual novel adaption of the first Silent Hill game titled Play Novel Silent Hill was released for the Game Boy Advance on March 21, 2001. A film adaptation, also titled Silent Hill , was released on April 21, 2006. Directed by Christophe Gans , the film was loosely based on the game, incorporating elements from Silent Hill 2 , Silent Hill 3 , and Silent Hill 4: The Room . Gans replaced Harry Mason with a female protagonist, Rose Da Silva , believing that Harry possessed qualities typically perceived as feminine. When designing the film's visual elements, Gans was influenced by directors Michael Mann , David Lynch , and David Cronenberg . The film's soundtrack featured music composed by Akira Yamaoka. Although critical reception was mostly negative, the film was a financial success and was praised by fans, particularly for its visuals. A "" reimagining "" of Silent Hill , titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories , was developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment . The game was released on December 8, 2009, for the Wii and on January 19, 2010, for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable , to mostly positive reviews. While it retains the premise of a man's search for his missing daughter, Shattered Memories branches off into a different plot with altered characters. It features psychological profiling, which alters various in-game elements based on the player's responses during therapy sessions, lacks the combat seen in Silent Hill , and replaces the ""Otherworld"" with a series of chase sequences through an alternate frozen version of the town. A remake by Bloober Team was announced to be in development in June 2025. Silent Hill received ""generally favorable reviews"" on the review aggregate website Metacritic . The game sold over two million copies, which earned Silent Hill a spot in the American PlayStation Greatest Hits budget releases. In November 1999, the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) awarded Silent Hill a ""Gold"" certification, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Silent Hill has often been compared to the Resident Evil series of survival horror video games. Bobba Fatt of GamePro labeled Silent Hill a ""shameless but slick Resident Evil clone"", while Edge described it as ""a near-perfect sim nightmare."" Others viewed Silent Hill as Konami's answer to the Resident Evil series. While they noted the similarities, Silent Hill utilized a different form of horror, focusing on creating a disturbing atmosphere to evoke fear, in contrast to the visceral scares and action-oriented approach of Resident Evil . Contributing to this atmosphere was the game's audio, which received praise. Billy Matjiunis of TVG described the ambient music as ""engrossing"", while a reviewer for Game Revolution remarked that the sound and music effectively set players on edge. AllGame editor Michael L. House praised Silent Hill , describing it as ""a truly magnificent work of art"" and ""a genuinely terrifying experience combined with a unique, gripping story and immersive atmosphere."" However, the voice acting was less well received. While some reviewers found it superior to that of the Resident Evil series, it was generally considered poor, with pauses between lines that disrupted the atmosphere. Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, unlike the pre-rendered backgrounds found in Resident Evil . Fog and darkness were heavily used to mask the hardware's limitations. Despite this, most reviewers felt these factors enhanced the game's atmosphere. Francesca Reyes of IGN noted that these elements ""added to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay."" However, the use of 3D environments introduced control issues, and maneuverability in tougher areas became ""an exercise in frustration."" Edge selected Silent Hill as runner-up for the Gameplay Innovation award, noting that while other games attempted to hide the PlayStation's visual limitations, Konami used the draw-distance deficiency to chilling effect by enveloping the environment in atmospheric fog. The game's lasting popularity as the first in the series was recognized long after its release. A 2000 list of the best PlayStation games by IGN ranked it as the 14th-best, while GameSpy 's 2005 article on the best PlayStation games placed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. In a 2006 GameTrailers video feature, Silent Hill was ranked number one on its list of the top ten scariest games of all time. In 2005, the game was credited for moving the survival horror genre away from B movie horror elements and toward the psychological style seen in art house and Japanese horror films, due to its focus on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. In November 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.",Team Silent,"NA : February 23, 1999 [ 1 ] JP : March 4, 1999 EU : July 16, 1999 [ 2 ]",PlayStation,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,birth; daughter; infant; labor; mother,wife,,body; memories; soul,imprisoned; prison,kill; killed,forced,creature; evil; hag; monster; witch,girl; young,

Silent Hill: Origins,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill%3A_Origins," Silent Hill: Origins (stylized as Silent Hill: 0rigins ) is a 2007 survival horror game developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami . It was released worldwide in late 2007 for the PlayStation Portable , beginning in early November with the United Kingdom. A port for the PlayStation 2 was released worldwide in early 2008, beginning in March with North America. The fifth installment in the Silent Hill series, Origins is a prequel to the first game (1999). Set in the series' eponymous, fictional American town , Origins follows trucker Travis Grady as he searches for information about a girl whom he rescued from a fire. Along the way, he unlocks his repressed childhood memories. Gameplay uses a third-person perspective , and emphasizes combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving, similar to the previous installments. Origins was developed by the Portsmouth branch of the Climax Group, which was known as Climax Action at the time. It was transferred from the Los Angeles Climax branch, who closed down after facing issues with the game engine and the vision of the game; the script, monsters, and level design were redone, and aspects of Origins ' atmosphere and gameplay intentionally replicated those of the first Silent Hill game. Origins was generally positively reviewed, although some reviewers wrote that it followed the formula of the series too closely and failed to add anything new. Its PlayStation 2 port received a lower aggregate score, with criticism directed towards its visuals. The objective of Silent Hill: Origins is to guide player character, Travis Grady, as he searches the monster-filled town of Silent Hill for information about a girl he rescued from a burning house. The game uses a third-person perspective which it alternates with fixed camera angles. Following the gameplay formula of previous Silent Hill games, Origins primarily revolves around combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Typical gameplay of Origins consists of alternating between reality and its darker and dilapidated counterpart, the "" Other World "", to obtain keys and objects needed to solve a riddle. Travis carries a flashlight and indicates the direction of a nearby usable item, while his  portable radio alerts the player to the presence of nearby monsters by emitting static. Often, actions performed in one dimension will affect the other; for example, raising a prop on the stage in the theater results in a similar reaction in the Other World. Once solved, the riddle leads to an encounter with a boss , whose defeat unlocks a new area. Completion of the game results in unlocking special items or alternative outfits for Travis depending on various accomplishments. For combat, in addition to using his fists (marking the first time unarmed combat is possible in a Silent Hill game), Travis accumulates a range of weapons throughout the town: firearms, melee weapons, and one-shot items usable in close combat; the latter two are breakable. Although one-shot items can be used to quickly kill some of the monsters encountered early on, Travis is vulnerable while performing this action to damage from quick enemies or those with long-ranged attacks. Origins also introduces the ""grapple"" system, a quick time event activated when a monster grabs him. Should he escape, no damage is done to either him or the monster. The status of his "" health "" is indicated in the inventory, since the game does not feature a heads-up display ; however, when his health is critical, the edges of the screen throb red, and his heartbeat is heard. A prequel to the first Silent Hill installment , Silent Hill: Origins takes place several years before the events of the first game. Origins is set in the eponymous, foggy, and rural small town located in the northeastern United States . The town is characterized by the ""Other World"", a supernatural location periodically encountered by the protagonists of the series. Most frequently assuming the form of the town, the Other World causes the characters to experience delusions and various symbols from their unconscious . Origins introduces Travis Grady, a trucker with a troubled past who suffers from nightmares. Returning characters from the first installment are Alessa Gilespie, a young girl who possesses supernatural powers; licensed practical nurse Lisa Garland, who has a drug addiction and dreams of being an actress instead of a nurse; physician Michael Kaufmann, who supplies Lisa with illegal drugs; and Alessa's mother, Dahlia Gillespie, a member of the town's cult which plans to bring its malevolent god into this world. Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, Travis swerves his truck to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While following the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate her with the cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: his mother had been committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, Travis kills the Butcher, a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters. Travis continues following Alessa's spirit manifestation, which refuses to speak to him, and gradually collects pieces of an unknown pyramid-shaped object; after collecting all of the pieces, he assembles them to form the Flauros, an artifact which contains a trapped demon and can be used to amplify thought. Alessa's spirit manifestation uses the completed Flauros to increase her powers and free herself from Dahlia's spell, which had inhibited her abilities. Dahlia reveals that the cult plans to use Alessa to give birth to its god, before leaving to take part in the ritual. Travis heads to the cult's ritual grounds, and sees members of the cult, including Kaufmann, surrounding Alessa's burned body. Incapacitated by Kaufmann, Travis defeats and imprisons the demon within the Flauros in a dream-like state. There are three endings available, with less dependence on the player's actions during the game than in other installments of the series. In the ""Good"" ending, Alessa uses the Flauros to manifest a baby with half of her soul, stopping the ritual, and her spirit manifestation carries the baby to the outskirts of the town, seeing Travis off as he returns to his truck and cheerfully drives away from Silent Hill. Dialogue follows to reveal that the protagonist of the first game, Harry Mason, and his wife find and adopt the baby, naming her Cheryl, while Dahlia and Kaufmann plan to cast a spell to draw the other half of Alessa's soul back to the town, setting the events of the first Silent Hill game in motion. In the ""Bad"" ending, Travis awakens strapped to a gurney and is injected with an unknown substance: he starts convulsing and has a series of visions in which he kills two people and his form is briefly replaced by that of the Butcher. The joke ending sees Travis leave in a UFO with an alien and a dog in order to search for his now-missing truck. At E3 2006, Origins was announced as in development by Climax Group's development team in Los Angeles, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews of the game featured a departure from the third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4 -style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat to a greater degree than the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006. Issues with the game's engine and ""a confused high-level vision for the game"" led to Climax shutting down their Los Angeles studio, and transferring the game's team to the Climax Action studio in the United Kingdom, to ensure the final product would be ""a tighter, more focused game that will provide fans with the experience they want... a Silent Hill experience""; the release date was also pushed forward from winter 2006 to Q3/Q4 2007. The version of Origins that the United Kingdom development team received was intended to be a dark comedy inspired by the American television series Scrubs . Konami allowed the team to change the game, provided that the changes were done within the same budget and time frame; Origins ' s script, level design, and monsters were redone within a week by Sam Barlow. For Origins , the developers intentionally replicated aspects of gameplay and atmosphere from the first installment; for example, the monsters behave more aggressively than those in previous installments, as a throwback to the first game. Later previews showed that the game had changed significantly and contained gameplay more in line with that found in the previous titles in the series. The changes were well received by video game journalists . On 19 August 2007, a demo of the game was leaked to internet download sites; Climax promptly denied they were the source of the leaked content. Origins was released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on 6 November 2007 in North America, on 16 November in Europe, on 29 November in Australia, and on 6 December in Japan. The Japanese release carried the alternate title Silent Hill Zero . On 22 January 2008, Konami officially confirmed that a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port was in development. The PS2 port was released in North America on 5 March 2008, while the United Kingdom and Australian releases followed on 16 May 2008, and 23 May 2008, respectively. It became available on the PlayStation Network for Europe on 28 April 2014. Released as Silent Hill Zero Original Soundtracks , the musical score of Origins was composed by Akira Yamaoka , who had created the music of previous games in the series, and released in Japan on 25 January 2008, by Konami Music Entertainment, Inc. As Origins is a prequel, Yamaoka wished to imbue its music with the atmosphere of the first installment. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn provided vocals for four tracks, for which Joe Romersa wrote the lyrics. All three had previously worked together on the music of the fourth installment of the series (2004). Most reviews for Silent Hill: Origins were positive; its original release on the PSP received a Metacritic aggregate score of 78 out of 100. GameDaily wrote that Origins ""impressively brings all the elements we love about the Silent Hill franchise to a portable format that works wonderfully"". Shane Bettenhausen of 1UP.com concluded: ""Sure, it's predictable, conventional, and a little bit short, not to mention ill-suited for brief pick-up-and-play sessions on the bus, but we're encouraged to see developers making an original, console-quality experience for PSP"". According to Kristan Reed of Eurogamer : ""No doubt mindful of remaining faithful to the series' legacy, Climax pays such close attention to the ingredients of the first three Silent Hill games that it's basically an unapologetic homage to them"". While stating that Origins would appeal to fans for its story that adds to the series' mythos, Game Informer added: ""Unfortunately, the game has fallen into something like a rut in most other areas and less fanatical gamers won't be as forgiving of its faults"". The storyline was met with generally mixed feelings from reviewers. According to Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot , the premise was unoriginal and unsuspenseful, detracting from Travis' appeal as a protagonist, although he felt that the game provided new material for fans to analyze. PALGN ' s Mat Keller wrote that the Origins ' ""blatantly obvious"" subtext failed to affect the player, in contrast to the subtext of previous installments. 1UP.com stated that while Origins suffered from heavy foreshadowing and predictable plot twists and character development, it added to the backstory of the series. Conversely, Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com described the storyline as ""engrossing"". Critics felt that the visual style was similar to those of the previous Silent Hill installments. Enjoying the visuals, Jeff Haynes of IGN wrote: ""From the cluttered and junk strewn locations to the rusty, chaos filled doppelgangers of the alternate dimensions, everything feels like it's been stripped from one of the other titles and shrunk down to the handheld"". Reviewers praised the graphics, the monster designs, the detailed environments, and atmosphere. However, some reviewers wrote that the character models could have been more detailed. Gameplay drew a variety of reactions from ""immersive"" and ""intriguing"", to formulaic. The puzzles were generally considered by critics as challenging and well-done. The duration of the game was considered short, and reviewers criticized the spacing of the save points and absence of checkpoints . The game's adherence to the formula of the Silent Hill series also drew criticism; the opening comment of GameSpot ' s review remarked that ""this old fog needs to learn some new tricks"", and further detailed that the game provided ""an entirely conventional adventure that relies on eight-year-old franchise hallmarks at the expense of anything truly new"". Some camera issues were noted, especially in tight corridors. Reviewers wrote that Origins had a greater emphasis on combat than previous installments, although reaction to the combat was generally negative. Some reviewers felt that the player was encouraged to avoid combat, due to a variety of gameplay factors, including the breakable melee weapons. On the other hand, GameSpy ' s David Chapman stated that the readily available weapons made Travis too powerful. The inclusion of quick time events was not well received by reviewers, who felt that it added nothing appealing to the game. Additionally, the soundtrack was frequently praised as frightening, and a part of the game's appeal. The PlayStation Official Magazine UK wrote: ""Despite its small-screen setting, Origins even manages a few genuine scares, mostly thanks to the first-rate sound: this should only be played through headphones"". The PS2 port was not as well received by reviewers, with a lower aggregate score of 70 out of 100, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". The graphics of the port were considered by reviewers to be not as good as the PSP release and other installments in the series for the PS2. Conversely, a reviewer for GameZone wrote that despite some technical issues with the graphics, the visuals of the port sufficed. Other issues with the port commented on by critics include the lack of manual camera control, the absence of a mini-map or overall map for the more challenging areas, and no new bonus material for the port.",Climax Studios,PlayStation Portable NA : 6 November 2007 EU : 16 November 2007 AU : 30 November 2007 JP : 6 December 2007 PlayStation 2 NA : 4 March 2008 EU : 16 May 2008 AU : 23 May 2008,PlayStation Portable PlayStation 2,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,baby; birth; mother,father; wife,,body; memories; soul,escape; prison,kill; killed,,evil; monster,girl; young; young girl,
Silent Hill: Shattered Memories,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill%3A_Shattered_Memories," Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is a 2009 survival horror game developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami . It was released in December for the Wii and ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable platforms in January 2010. In April 2014, it appeared on the PlayStation Network in Europe. Shattered Memories is a reimagination of the first game and retains the premise— Harry Mason 's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill —but is set in a different fictional universe and has a different plot, and altered characters, alongside new ones. Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing , first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to a more dangerous environment. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey. After designing the Silent Hill prequel (2007), which intentionally replicated elements of the first installment, Climax Studios wanted to try a different approach to creating a title in the series. Among the changes made was the removal of combat and the constant presence of monsters. Akira Yamaoka composed the soundtrack of the game, which was the first in the series to prominently feature dynamic music . The game received generally positive reviews for its graphics, plot, voice acting, soundtrack, and its use of the Wii Remote , and has been favorably compared to M. Night Shyamalan 's visuals. However, some reviewers found the puzzle exploration, chase sequences and psychological elements frustrating, and felt the game was too short. It has been since praised by some reviewers for its unique take on the franchise, clever twists to the original story, atmosphere and mechanics. Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is a reimagining of the first installment of the series, Silent Hill . It keeps the premise of writer Harry Mason looking for his daughter in Silent Hill after a car crash, although it leads into a different plot. The personalities and roles of characters from the first game have also been changed, and Shattered Memories introduces new characters as well. Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its gameplay between two different settings. The first section is set in a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann , who is a therapist NPC , from a first-person perspective . The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game. In the second setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he searches for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry is equipped with a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a GPS map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone. The game occasionally shifts to an icy alternate dimension called ""Nightmare"", where hostile monsters exist. To escape from this dimension, Harry must find a predetermined exit while avoiding the wandering creatures which chase him upon detection. Unlike previous installments in the series, there is no combat element to the gameplay: Harry is weaponless for the entire duration of the game and can only run, hide, slow down the monsters by knocking down objects to block their path, throw off the creatures if they latch onto him, and temporarily ward them off by picking up and using flares found lying on the ground. His running speed and "" health "" (the amount of damage that he can endure before dying) decrease every time the monsters grab him. In contrast to the previous installments of the series, which featured various types of monsters, Shattered Memories features only one type of humanoid monster, whose physical appearance changes in response to the player's actions inside and outside the Nightmare realm, including their responses to Kaufmann's psychological tests. The game begins with a psychotherapy session conducted by Dr. Kaufmann, which acts as a frame story for Harry's quest. Suffering from issues with his memory, Harry travels home to search for his seven-year-old daughter Cheryl, hoping that she is already there. His consciousness moves between the in-game real world and Nightmare —a frozen version of the town in which monsters chase him—and finds that another family lives in his house. Police officer Cybil Bennett arrives and decides to take him to the police station, but they become caught in a blizzard, and Harry eventually leaves her car to continue his search. Eventually, Harry finds his way to the local high school, where he learns from a woman named Michelle Valdez that a Cheryl Mason attended school there previously, but then moved. She offers to drive Harry to Cheryl's new address, but after briefly stepping away, he returns to find Michelle has been replaced by Dahlia Mason , who claims to be Harry's lover and acts as if she has been with him the whole time. He accepts the ride, although during another shift to the Nightmare, the car falls into a river. Harry escapes but loses consciousness. He awakens in a wheelchair pushed by Cybil in the town's hospital. Before Cybil can tell him about his file at the station, the town transitions to the Nightmare. Harry escapes and meets Lisa Garland, a nurse injured in a crash, and escorts her to her home. At her request, Harry gives Lisa pills for her headache, and returns to find her either dead or dying, depending on in-game actions taken by the player. Finding him next to Lisa's corpse, Cybil attempts to arrest him, but is frozen as the Nightmare emerges around them. Harry escapes to Cheryl's home, where he finds an older Dahlia who claims to be his wife and tells him that Cheryl is at the lighthouse. Harry enters the Nightmare, escapes it, and eventually gets a ride from Michelle. Harry finds a young-again Dahlia aboard a boat at a lakeside harbour, who sets the course for the lighthouse and seduces him. Harry wakes, finds an aged Dahlia and the environment covered in ice, and crosses the now-frozen lake but falls into the water and passes out. Harry is dragged ashore near the lighthouse by Cybil, who confronts him with the news that Harry Mason died eighteen years ago in a car accident. As Harry proceeds, he finds ""the lighthouse"" is the name of Dr. Kaufmann's counseling clinic: the patient in the therapy session is an adult Cheryl, who is in denial over her father's death. Harry enters the office and Cheryl either reconciles herself to his death or continues to cling to her fantasy father. At the end of the game, an old video clip from Cheryl's camcorder is played. Four variations of this clip are available depending upon the player's actions as Harry. In ""Love Lost"", Harry packs his luggage in a car and tells Cheryl not to blame herself for her parents' separation. In ""Drunk Dad"", a drunken Harry yells at Cheryl, demands a beer and blames his drinking on his family. In ""Sleaze and Sirens"", Harry flirts on his bed with Lisa and Michelle. In ""Wicked and Weak"", Dahlia verbally abuses Harry and slaps him. In the ""UFO"" joke ending, Cheryl tells Dr. Kaufmann that she believes Harry was kidnapped by aliens and that Silent Hill is a spaceship. After James Sunderland interrupts, the therapy session continues, revealing Cheryl to be a dog and Dr. Kaufmann to be an alien . Regardless of the ending, the final scene shows Cheryl packing away mementos that the player can collect throughout the game. An additional scene the player can obtain shows her reconciling with Dahlia outside the clinic. Plans for a Silent Hill remake, and speculation about a possible remake based on the Silent Hill film , were circulating as early as 2006. The idea of a remake was also considered early in the development of the prequel game Silent Hill: Origins (2007). After the release of Silent Hill: Origins, Climax pitched two ideas to Konami: Brahms PD and Silent Hill: Cold Heart respectively. Brahms PD followed a detective with amnesia in the neighboring town of Brahms looking for their partner, while Silent Hill: Cold Heart would have followed a mentally disturbed college student and replaced the foggy setting of the former games with ice and snow. Elements from both pitches were used to create the basis for Shattered Memories. Rumours persisted into 2009, and were seemingly confirmed in February when the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) re-rated the original game. The game was officially announced in the May 2009 issue of Nintendo Power . Climax Studios , the developer of Silent Hill: Origins , developed Shattered Memories with a development team made up of more than 55 members and a supporting network of more than 90 artists. With the completion of Origins - for which they had attempted to closely replicate the atmosphere and gameplay elements of the first Silent Hill game (1999) — Climax Studios wanted to create another horror game. Because of the tenth anniversary of the first Silent Hill installment, Konami thought the time was ideal ""to revisit"" the game. Climax Studios saw the then-newly introduced Wii platform as a way to reach a wider range of gamers, especially as outside Japan, no Silent Hill title had been exclusively released on a Nintendo platform. Development costs for the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and their gamers' ""mindset"" factored into the decision for the gaming platform. Additionally, the developers wanted to use the Wii Remote to incorporate the gameplay elements of the flashlight and radio static. Climax felt that the first game would be a good starting point, instead of continuing any existing storylines or adding onto the mythology of the town. To please fans of the series and bring in new ones, they decided to reimagine the setting and characters, such as Dahlia, who was changed from ""a haggard old woman"" who led the town's cult into a physically attractive young woman. Game designer Sam Barlow explained in November 2022 that he was not a fan of Silent Hill 3 as he disliked the continuation of Harry and Cheryl Mason's adventures as well as the bad endings in Silent Hill . He felt he could redeem the series by reimagining the first game through Shattered Memories. Climax Studios began with the game's plot, which the development team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill , and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States , where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: ""Ultimately every little thing you do in the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research"". The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer , Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player. Hitchcock said that all horror goes back to childhood, that's why it's a universal thing -- it's a fundamental. How many children wake up screaming because they had a dream where they beat up a zombie with a baseball bat? You wake up screaming because you ran and you got caught. The developers felt that creating another game in the series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential. In an attempt to imbue the game with the feel of a horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful, they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons. Instead they generated an unarmed player character; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents, inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996). They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films, including horror films, and the structure of slasher films , in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists. The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat, and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist. The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player, although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters, and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player's immersion in the game and interest in the story. The constant presence of monsters was also thought to be irrelevant to Shattered Memories ; director Mark Simmons said, ""this Harry Mason is not a guy who is constantly under attack from monsters. It's not a story of surviving a zombie apocalypse"". Additionally, to make information-gathering in the game realistic and corresponding to modern life standards, the developers substituted text in scattered documents, a common element in survival horror games, for the player's interaction with the in-game environment and use of the cell phone. Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka scored the soundtrack of Shattered Memories . It was his final contribution to the Silent Hill series before he resigned from Konami after 16 years with the company. Voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn provided vocals for four musical pieces included in the game and co-directed Shattered Memories ' voice acting, and musician Joe Romersa wrote lyrics for three of the pieces. The game is the first in the series to make prominent use of dynamic music ; a composition is introduced and subsequently retracted, based on the player's actions, in every major area of the game. Widely varying compositions, ranging from undertones to rock music, were produced for the game. A playable demo of Shattered Memories was made available in June 2009 at the annual trade fair Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 (E3) and received favorable reviews from video game journalists. A group of editors of the IGN website gave the game three ""Best of E3"" awards in the Wii category for best overall game, best adventure game , and best video game graphics technology. The game was also given a ""Best Wii Game"" award by editors of the GameSpot website in an article on their preferred games featured at the E3 show. Shattered Memories was published by Konami for the Wii in North America on 8 December 2009; in Europe on 26 February 2010; and in Japan on 25 March. The Australian release was delayed until 22 June, due to European supply problems caused by the economic effects of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull . Major Australian retailers struggled to confirm available copies of the game for several months after the delayed release, potentially damaging initial sales of the game. The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were published in North America on 19 January 2010; in Europe on 26 February; in Japan on 25 March; and in Australia on 22 April 2010. It also became available on the PlayStation Network for Europe and the United Kingdom on 28 April 2014. A PlayStation Vita release for Shattered Memories was apparently planned, but was cancelled. According to producer Tomm Hulett, the number of pre-ordered copies of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories ""looked very good"". In March 2010, the game placed fifth on the list of the top forty bestselling PS2 videogames in the United Kingdom and eleventh on the corresponding list for Wii games. However, NintendoWorldReport stated that sales of the game were low. The game eventually broke even with the help of the PS2 port, selling an estimated 440,000 copies across all platforms. Review aggregator website Metacritic displays an averaged score for Silent Hill: Shattered Memories of 79/100, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com ranked Shattered Memories in seventh place on his list of ""top ten nerve-shredding video games"", and wrote: ""Dark, dank and dangerous, Silent Hill grabs you by the scruff of the neck, shakes you till you throw up, then headbutts you right between the eyes"". Gamasutra ' s Brandon Sheffield , ranked the game in fifth place on his top ten list of overlooked games of 2009, and wrote that despite the absence of horror elements, the game was a nice experience. Matt Wales of IGN also included the game in a list of overlooked Wii games, and wrote that the combination of various elements which he regarded as positive delivered ""a meticulously-constructed, expertly-paced experience quite unlike anything the series has seen before"". Chris Schilling of The Daily Telegraph described it as ""one of the most innovative and enjoyable survival horrors for many a year"". Eurogamer ' s Kristan Reed wrote: ""Packed with inventive ideas and one engaging sequence after another, it's a spirited, poignant and unsettling game that not only delivers a long-overdue return to form, but reinvigorates horror adventures in the process"". According to Lark Anderson of GameSpot , "" Shattered Memories is a fantastic return to the core concept of personal fear, and though its developers made some unorthodox decisions - such as removing combat entirely - those decisions have paid off handsomely"". Nintendo Power called it audacious and compelling. In a retrospective feature, NintendoWorldReport ' s Jonathan Metts generally agreed with GameSpot , stating that the installment ""is a noble and arguably successful attempt to revive and reform the survival horror genre. While perhaps not scary, it is genuinely disturbing, shocking, and always interesting"". According to Leigh Alexander of The A.V. Club , the innovation and uniqueness of the installment made it capable of standing alone from the Silent Hill series, without having to use the series' reputation or name to attract players. Conversely, Game Informer ' s Tim Turi considered the frustrating controls and dull pacing to be major flaws, and wrote: ""If you’re a Silent Hill fan interested in a fresh take on the stale formula, this Wii entry may be the Cheryl you’ve been searching for, but it comes at a cost"". The division of gameplay into puzzle-based exploration, weaponless chase sequences, and therapy scenes drew mixed comments from reviewers. About.com ' s Charles Herold wrote that the fast-paced action of the nightmare sequences and the therapy scenes undercut the ""trapped in a nightmare"" feeling of previous Silent Hill games. Matt Casamassina of IGN wrote that ""the separation between safe exploration and puzzling and run-for-your-life monster scenarios is too transparent and as a result you will inevitably come to fear the ice and few things else"". PALGN ' s Michael Kontoudis said that the chase sequences severely detracted from the rest of the game. Eurogamer wrote that they created a welcome mix with no gameplay element overemphasized. Reviewers were also divided on whether the chase sequences were potentially frustrating, or quickly grew repetitive. GamesRadar ' s Henry Gilbert expressed frustration over the similar enemies and repetitive use of a stock scream. Neon Kelly of VideoGamer.com was concerned by the absence of a possible death of the player character which would result in a "" game over "", because he esteemed the fear potentially caused to the player by player character death as a major element of the survival horror genre. The use of the Wii Remote was praised by reviewers as natural-seeming, and well-suited to the movement-based puzzles and scenes. Shattered Memories ' reimagined plot received praise from reviewers, some of whom found it easier to follow than the plot of the first game. Game Informer drew comparisons with film director M. Night Shyamalan 's style. GamesRadar wrote that the storyline and characterizations were mature, its puzzles clear yet challenging and that the atmospheric scares contributed to the game's appeal. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com said that the text messages about minor characters not introduced in the game detracted from the overall narrative. The game's duration, considered relatively short by reviewers, was seen as a drawback, although some reviewers said that the psychological elements and multiple endings increased the replay value of the game. The psychological elements were also criticized. About.com wrote that they were far less subtle than those in Silent Hill 2 , and GamePro ' s Will Herring said that while the player-profiling element was ambitious, he did not think it went far enough, as it changed only cosmetic details and character dialogue. Reviewers praised the graphics, and called them detailed and well-done. Chris McMahon of Play placed the game tenth on his list of the ""ten best-looking PSP games"". GameTrailers praised the variety of objects, many of which can be manipulated by the player, and the detailed textures which lent the game's environments authenticity. The soundtrack was favorably received, and reviewers described it as moody, atmospheric, and helping to create tension. The voice acting was similarly well-received as believable. Additionally, the soundtrack won an award for its audio design at the Milthon European Games Awards, an event held in Paris, France, at the Paris Game Festival; the awards were handed out by an eight-person jury and the French Minister of Culture and Communication . Metacritic shows an averaged score of 77/100 for the PlayStation 2 port, indicating generally favorable reviews. Casamassina gave the PS2 port a score of 8.0/10, and wrote that while the graphics and control system in the Wii version were better, the port held up well. For the PlayStation Portable port, Metacritic displays an averaged score of 73/100, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Casamassina gave it a score of 7.0, and commented upon the ""obvious visual downgrades"", ""sluggish controls"", and ""the inability to directly control and point his flashlight"". In his review of both ports, Haywald said that the control systems of both ports worked well, and described them as ""a technical triumph"".",Climax Studios,"Wii NA : 8 December 2009 EU : 26 February 2010 JP : 25 March 2010 AU : 22 April 2010 PS2 , PSP NA : 19 January 2010 EU : 26 February 2010 JP : 25 March 2010 AU : 22 April 2010",Wii PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,daughter,family; father; wife,,memories,escape; kidnapped,kill; killed,,creature; evil; hag; monster,high school; student; teen; young,
Silent Hill: The Short Message,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill%3A_The_Short_Message," Silent Hill: The Short Message is a 2024 psychological horror game developed and published by Konami Digital Entertainment for PlayStation 5 . The game was announced and released for free on 31 January 2024 and became available for PlayStation Plus members. It follows a teenage girl who receives bizarre text messages from a friend who committed suicide and must look for clues in an abandoned apartment complex in Germany. At the same time, a monster covered in cherry blossom petals pursues her and cannot be attacked. Silent Hill: The Short Message is played from a first-person perspective with no combat. Bullying, the impacts of social media, and suicide are the primary themes of the game. It received mixed reviews; while some critics praised its visuals, atmosphere, themes, and being available for free, others criticized its gameplay, dialogue, and chase sequences. Rather than the eponymous town of Silent Hill, the game is set in the economically depressed fictional German town of Kettenstadt. It takes place within an abandoned apartment complex called the Villa, a popular graffiti site and infamous suicide hotspot among teenage girls. A young woman named Anita receives a message from her friend and Internet famous graffiti artist Maya, known online as C. B. (Cherry Blossoms), requesting to meet in the Villa; upon entering, she follows a trail of Maya's artworks throughout the building, beset flashbacks regarding the online harassment she experienced while trying to be as popular online as Maya. She is stalked by a monster (unnamed in the game but later revealed to be called Sakura Head) which is covered in blooming cherry blossoms . Unable to make contact with Maya, Anita receives a call from her other friend Amelie, who remarks that Maya is already dead, having jumped off the roof of the Villa some time ago. Anita is shocked that she would forget something so important and wonders who is messaging her as Maya. She winds up on the roof and discovers Maya's final art piece. Jealous of the popularity Maya experienced, Anita steps off the roof in an attempt to emulate her suicide. Still alive, Anita awakens in the Villa, which is now in a dilapidated and vandalized state. She receives another message from Maya stating that neither of them can leave until Anita finds something undisclosed. Forced to explore the Villa again, she relives memories of Maya being bullied at school, before returning to the Villa. She finds an artwork of Maya's which she had never seen before, depicting Amelie. Anita recalls how Maya always seemed much closer to Amelie than her and that she felt ignored by Maya. Continuing on, Anita comes to her school library, where she learns about how Kettenstadt was supposedly cursed by a Japanese witch after her death. She finds a letter written by Maya begging Amelie for help, and recalls that she purposely withheld the letter from Amelie due to her jealousy over Maya's close friendship with Amelie, which she believes led to Maya's suicide. She returns to the roof, where she calls Amelie and admits her guilt over Maya's death before jumping off the roof a second time. Anita awakens back in the Villa. Exploring the building once again, she finds herself in her childhood home, and recalls how her mother both neglected and abused her and her younger brother by locking them in the closet. This culminated in Anita's brother dying while locked up and her mother attempting to hide his body in the refrigerator before Anita escaped and reported her to the police. She discovers that Maya was planning to make an artwork depicting her as well, confirming that Maya had not been ignoring her as she believed. The monster chases Anita for a final time again before she finds herself back on the roof, where she apologizes to Amelie for not realizing how much both she and Maya valued their friendship with her. She considers jumping off the roof again but stops herself at the last second, which causes the fog surrounding the Villa to disappear, returning Anita to reality. Some time later, a social media post by Amelie indicates that both she and Anita have left Kettenstadt to start new lives at college. Motoi Okamoto , producer for the Silent Hill series, stated the game's main themes are suicide, cyberbullying, social media, and mental health. Creature designer and Silent Hill veteran Masahiro Ito continued, ""I felt that, definitely, this was something that would really resonate with a younger generation, given that so many of them are active on social media."" In 2022, screenshots from the game were leaked under the title Sakura . Silent Hill: The Short Message was rated in South Korea in September 2022 and in December 2022, The Short Message was rated in Taiwan. In October 2022, Konami began hiring for upcoming Silent Hill projects, including an unannounced in-house game. Silent Hill: The Short Message received ""mixed or average"" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic , with 31% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic . Christopher Teuton from Screen Rant wrote in his review: ""For a free game that shows the first glimpse of what Konami is truly going to do with the franchise, Silent Hill: The Short Message is absolutely worth experiencing"". ""It's a far better start than it could have been, and it is undeniably the best new Silent Hill media since 2014, although the game's effectiveness in handling these topics will vary depending on a person's own relationship with them."" Writing for IGN , Koji Fukuyama and Daniel Robson commended the game's ""effective use of themes... to create a feeling of genuine dread"", describing the game as a modern and impactful iteration of the Silent Hill franchise. In contrast, Mark Delaney of GameSpot described the game as a ""bad Silent Hill caricature"", critiquing its ""trial-and-error"" chase sequences and ""on-the-nose"" plot and dialogue. Willa Rowe of Kotaku found the game to be ""unnecessarily graphic"" and its themes ""shallow and heavy-handed"", observing the game's ending twist to be predictable. In a review for Polygon , Carli Velocci compared many aspects of the game to previous Silent Hill titles such as P.T. and Silent Hill: Downpour , and found the references to the series at large ""extremely unsubtle"", while describing the game's presentation of its suicide themes as ""borderline tacky"", observing that the writing ""doesn't give Anita much more definition beyond her mental illness."" Still, she ultimately concluded that the game has its merits, such as ""some unique imagery that makes me feel optimistic about the series' future"".

Slender: The Arrival,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender%3A_The_Arrival," Slender: The Arrival is a 2013 survival horror video game developed by Blue Isle Studios and Parsec Productions. Based on the Slender Man , a creepypasta character created by Eric Knudsen, who served as a producer, it is a sequel to Parsec's Slender: The Eight Pages (2012), and incorporates a remake of that game. It revolves around a young woman who ventures on the woods to unravel the mystery about her childhood best friend's disappearance. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on March 26, 2013. It was later released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in September 2014, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2015, Wii U in October 2015, Nintendo Switch in June 2019, and Android and iOS in October 2021. Slender: The Arrival received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its soundtrack, atmosphere, and jump scares . Criticism was directed at its short length and repetitive gameplay. A 10th anniversary remaster was released for Windows, PlayStation 5 , and Xbox Series X/S on October 18, 2023. Virtual reality versions are planned for release in late 2025. A sequel, S: The Lost Chapters , is scheduled for release in 2026. Slender: The Arrival is a survival horror video game played from a first-person perspective. The game take places in abandoned areas such as a house, the woods, and a defunct mine, each with different objectives. Like its predecessor, The Eight Pages , the player is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive is to run whenever in danger. The titular Slender Man 's behavior changes slightly between levels. In the first level, the Slender Man can be seen outside of the house through every window, once the player acquires the flashlight, and after going through the gate outside, he can be seen on the top of the hills. In the second level, the Slender Man most often teleports off-screen or just out of the player's sight, but is capable of appearing directly in front of them. His motion centers around following the player, but consists largely of jumping from place to place, increased as each of the eight pages are collected. In the third level, the Slender Man's behavior is less aggressively, though he is capable of teleporting directly in front of the player. In this level, the player is chased by a masked, hooded figure controlled by the Slender Man. The only way to subdue her is by focusing the flashlight on her face. The figure will also lunge at the player if in a close distance. While looking at the Slender Man, the camera succumbs to electronic distortions such as static, blurring, color spots, and audio distortion, which obstructs the player's vision unless facing away, and far enough from him. The player cannot pause the game while this occurs, to prevent them taking a break due to being frightened. When caught, the game over screen will appear as a black static background with the Slender Man's faceless head, an overhead-lit, and a color-distorted hue. New difficulty choices can be unlocked once completed the game, being 'easy', 'normal', and 'hardcore'. 'Easy' has infinite flashlight, a great deal of stamina, and the enemies are not very aggressive. 'Hardcore' has a limited flashlight, the stamina runs out quickly, and the enemies are more aggressive. An additional level is unlocked after the main story is completed and acts as a remake of The Eight Pages , with Kate as the protagonist. After finding all the pages, the Slender Man catches her and claims that he ""has plans for her"". A secret level is also unlockable, which takes place at Kate's house in the daytime. The goal is basically a hide-and-seek from the Slender Man, but it is unknown who the playable character is. A woman named Lauren arrives to help her childhood best friend Kate sell and move out of her childhood home in Oakside Park. The road to Kate's house is blocked by a fallen tree, forcing Lauren to leave her car and walk to the house. Upon arrival, Lauren discovers Kate's belongings disheveled. She finds a flashlight and unlocks Kate's bedroom to see the walls filled with scratchings and messages about the Slender Man , a tall, faceless entity who can only be seen through video cameras . Lauren hears Kate's screams coming from outside and heads into the wooded park behind the house. On her way, Lauren reaches a burnt farmhouse, where she finds a deformed child-like figure who disappears when Lauren approaches him. She searches the park for clues as to Kate's whereabouts, but only finds eight scribbled drawings. As Lauren ventures deeper into the woods, she is attacked by the Slender Man, slips down an embankment and passes out. She regains consciousness in the morning, and continues her search for Kate, stumbling upon an abandoned coal mine . Lauren attempts to power the mine's emergency lift, but is attacked by a masked, hooded figure known as the ""Chaser"", who seems to have photophobia . Evading the Chaser and the Slender Man, Lauren powers and uses the lift to escape the mine. She continues up the mountainside towards a radio tower and reaches a storage outpost with a television and two tapes. The first one shows Kate hurriedly scribbling upon papers before learning that the Slender Man is trying to get inside her house. Kate closes every door and window, but the Slender Man appears in her bedroom and she jumps out of the window as the tape abruptly ends. The second tape shows Kate's childhood friend Carl ""CR"" Ross investigating a farm where he collects evidence about Charles Matheson, whose son Charlie disappeared in a nearby beach after following a trail of toy trains that led him into the woods, where he was caught by the Slender Man. CR uses gas canisters to power a generator, and uses a key to unlock a gate to a chapel where he discovers that the Matheson family were responsible for accidentally summoning the Slender Man to Oakside Park. Charlie, revealed as the deformed figure Lauren found, pursues CR and eventually chases him away from the farm. Lauren continues onward to the radio tower and finds another storage outpost with a box of files. She learns that sometime after Charlie's disappearance, Charles saw him in his proxified form before being attacked by the Slender Man. He wakes up in a derelict hospital which he explores while facing many of the Slender Man's hallucinations. Charles eventually exits the hospital and finds a crying Charlie, but when he approaches his son, Charlie transforms again and attacks him. Charles finds himself back in the hospital and sees messages on the walls telling him that he can save Charlie by cleansing himself with fire and sets the hospital ablaze. Upon leaving the outpost, Lauren finds herself emerging from a mine into a forest fire, where the Slender Man aggressively pursues her. Lauren enters the radio tower building, where she discovers a dead end corridor and CR's burnt corpse . She finds a camera with a recording of Kate's and CR's panicked screams. Suddenly, the corridor goes dark and Charlie runs towards Lauren, blacking her out. Lauren wakes up in the burnt farmhouse's basement, with Charlie blocking the way out. After she finds two documents, Charlie disappears. Lauren hears Kate's crying upstairs and finds her, but Kate reveals herself as the Chaser and attacks her. Lauren's camera briefly turns back on to show her legs being dragged away by the Chaser as the camera dies. Slender: The Arrival was developed by Blue Isle Studios and Parsec Productions for Microsoft Windows and macOS . The developers were considering a release for the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 , and Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 . Blue Isle Studios worked with indie game publisher Midnight City to help develop the game for other platforms. On December 1, 2012, Blue Isle Studios announced its partnership with the Marble Hornets team, a YouTube channel known for its horror videos which heavily featured Slender Man , and helped to shape the modern version of the character. Joseph DeLage, Tim Sutton, and Troy Wagner helped write the script for the initial release of the game. On February 9, 2013, Slender: The Arrival was opened to the public for beta testing; those who pre-ordered the game were entitled to a free demo of the game. Pre-orders were $5 each, but once the game was released, it would be $10. On October 1, 2021, Blue Isle announced that the game would be released for Android and iOS on the 13th of the same month, with the first chapter being available for free. On July 27, 2023, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the game, Blue Isle announced a remastered version of the game made in Unreal Engine 5 which was released on October 18, of that year, including a redesign for the main antagonist, overhauled graphics, and a new story chapter. DLSS is also included. In October 2023, Blue Isle Studios announced a Halloween -themed event for the game, where the player must collect 30 pumpkins to unlock a special costume for Slender Man. In addition, they announced a cross-platform mod kit allowing users to create their own mods and chapters, a multiplayer mode, and three downloadable content chapters. On March 11 2025, virtual reality versions for Meta Quest 2 , Meta Quest 3 , Meta Quest 3S , Meta Quest Pro , PlayStation VR2 , and Microsoft Windows were announced for release on May 13, 2025. However, the ports were delayed until later in 2025. Slender: The Arrival received mixed reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic . Critics praised its soundtrack, tense atmosphere and scares, but also criticized its shorter-than-expected campaign length and repetitive gameplay. In a positive review, The Escapist said, ""you may have mixed feelings about its brevity and the repetitive mechanics, but it's certainly a well-built game that, above all, is scary to play"" and gave the game a score of 4.5 stars out of 5. VVGtv gave the game a score of 8.8/10, praising the game's graphics, sound, gameplay (with the exception of a few elements) and mystery element, while criticising the short story, adding that ""if you played The Eight Pages and are looking for the next scare to really get your adrenaline pumping and to get you to yell like you did when you first saw Slenderman right behind you, this game will not disappoint"". GameSpot gave the game a score of 8.5/10, calling it ""one of the most terrifying games in recent memory"". In a negative review, VideoGamer.com called The Arrival ""[...] a frustrating game, not just because it can be occasionally unfair but because these guys clearly have no idea how to promote fear. Running around playing kiss chase with a trans-dimensional being doesn't really cut it."" and gave it a score of 4/10. Alongside the announcement of the remaster, a sequel titled S: Lost Chapters was announced on July 27, 2023. The game will utilize more mechanics and feature more antagonists and locations, including some from The Arrival .

Sorry We're Closed,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry_We%27re_Closed," Sorry We're Closed is a 2024 survival horror video game developed by à la mode games and published by Akupara Games for Microsoft Windows . Versions for PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch were released in March 2025. Sorry We're Closed is a single-player survival horror game with multiple endings . The game is split into three phases. At the beginning of each night, the player can explore the city, speaking to other characters and choosing whether or not to help them. Each night also contains a combat stage, which requires killing demons, solving puzzles, and completing a boss fight. While exploring the combat stage, the game is played from a third-person fixed camera perspective, switching to an immobile first-person perspective when the player aims a weapon, which include an axe, pistol, and shotgun. The player character can also utilize a Third Eye, which momentarily stuns and reveals the weak spots of enemies within a short distance, but also negates any damage not done to weak points. Hitting combos on the weak points charges up the Heartbreaker, a special weapon that is crucial to defeating bosses and can kill standard enemies in one shot. In addition to its utility in combat, using the Third Eye is also key to several puzzles. Michelle, a young woman who works in a convenience store in London , struggles to move on after her ex-girlfriend, Leslie, broke up with her three years ago. Michelle has a nightmare of a demon who empathizes with her difficulties in love and proposes that she devote herself to them instead. Michelle awakens, only to find herself in another nightmare, chased by a bird-like demon named Dream Eater until she wakes up. The next night, Michelle's friend Robyn notices a scar on her forehead and informs her that she has been cursed by a powerful archdemon called the Duchess; if she does not come to love them in three days' time, she will meet her end. Robyn, also a demon, shows Michelle how to open her newly acquired Third Eye , with which she can see into the past and the demon world. In an abandoned London Underground station, Michelle is able to see the last moments of a previous victim of the Duchess's, a millionaire named Jenny who ultimately transformed into a monstrous rat. Rat Jenny eats Robyn, but Michelle manages to kill her. Exiting the tube station, Michelle finds herself in the Duchess's hotel, which hosts demons and houses the Duchess's victims, but manages to leave and get to the abandoned church, where the angel Benedict, Robyn's boyfriend, guards the gates of Hell. She discovers that Robyn survived Rat Jenny, and even obtained her Third Eye. Benedict tells Michelle that her best course of action is to dissolve the curses of other victims and collect their Third Eyes as well, which will weaken the curse and allow her to challenge the Duchess for her freedom. Michelle spends the next two nights fighting her way to two more victims of the curse and collecting their eyes. The second victim, Matilda, was a famous pop singer until she was cursed, and ultimately transformed into a monstrous squid creature in the abandoned aquarium. The third victim, Gabriella, entombed herself in her family crypt after acquiring the Third Eye and flaying herself alive. In between fights, Michelle can engage with a colorful cast of characters, some of who will influence her ultimate fate. Darrel, who works for the Duchess, entreats her for her help in getting his boyfriend, Oakley to accept his marriage proposal. At the same time, an angel named Clarissa wishes for Michelle to aid her in taking Darrel down, then replace him as the Duchess's right-hand man. Lucy, a silent young woman, is revealed to be a demon who offers to help Michelle destroy the Duchess for good and help her get back with her ex-girlfriend. The angel of love, Chamuel , is getting the cold shoulder from his demonic boyfriend (later revealed to be Dream Eater) to prevent them both from turning mortal, and is torn between pursuing their relationship even at the cost of their immortality or breaking the relationship off. The Duchess continues in their efforts to get Michelle to love them, though it becomes clear that they wish for her to love them in a way that would not be fulfilling for either of them. Depending on who she chooses to help, Michelle can choose to break the curse in a multitude of ways. If Michelle gives Robyn the Duchess's key, a powerful artifact that would allow Benedict to seal the gates of Hell permanently, leave his post, and be with Robyn, Michelle breaks the curse and returns to mundane life. If Michelle helps ruin Darrel's relationship, she becomes the Duchess's new right-hand man, managing the Duchess's hotel and Darrel's old bar, allowing Clarissa to kill more demons. If Michelle follows Lucy's instructions, which involve helping Darrel, encouraging Chamuel to kill Dream Eater, and giving the key to Robyn, Lucy destroys the Duchess and possesses Michelle's body, rendering her expressionless and mute, just as the girl that was her previous host. If Michelle encourages Chamuel to pursue love, she is able to convince the Duchess to let her in, and the force of her love is enough to turn them mortal, forgetting their memories of the past, but finding Michelle weeks later at the convenience store. Sorry We're Closed is the debut title of Bournemouth -based à la mode games, a two-person indie developer composed of creative director C. Bedford and technical director Tom Bedford. The game began development in November 2020 as a side-project during the COVID-19 pandemic , with the developers beginning to work on Sorry We're Closed full-time in late 2022. An announcement trailer for the game was published on 20 October 2023. Sorry We're Closed was exhibited at PAX East in March 2024, with a demo for the game released during Steam Next Fest in June 2024. The game was released on the previously announced release date of 14 November 2024. According to review aggregator Metacritic , Sorry We're Closed received ""generally favorable"" reviews, the eighth-highest score for a shooter video game in that year. The game was named as one of the best of 2024 by Eurogamer . Sorry We're Closed received praise for its narrative, characters and exploration mechanics, although some critics expressed criticism at the game's combat.",à la mode games,"Windows November 14, 2024 [ 1 ] PS4 , PS5 , XB1 , XSX/S , NS March 6, 2025",Windows PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X/S Nintendo Switch,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,,family; marriage,,body; memories,,kill,,creature; witch,girl; young,
The 7th Guest,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Guest," The 7th Guest is a 1993 interactive movie puzzle adventure game developed by Trilobyte and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment for DOS . It is one of the first computer video games to initially be released only on CD-ROM . The 7th Guest is a horror story told from the unfolding perspective of the player, as an amnesiac . The game received press attention for making live-action video clips a core part of its gameplay, as well as for its unprecedented amount of pre-rendered 3D graphics and its adult content. The game was critically and commercially successful, selling over two million copies. Alongside Myst , it is widely regarded as a killer app that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. Bill Gates called The 7th Guest ""the new standard in interactive entertainment"". The game has since been ported in various formats on different systems. The game is played by wandering through a mansion , solving logic puzzles and watching videos that further the story. The main antagonist, Henry Stauf, is an ever-present menace, taunting the player with clues, mocking the player as they fail his puzzles (""We'll all be dead by the time you solve this!""), and expressing displeasure when the player succeeds (""Don't think you'll be so lucky next time!""). A plot of manipulation and sin is gradually played out, in flashback, by actors through film clips as the player progresses between rooms by solving twenty-one puzzles of shifting nature and increasing difficulty. The first puzzles most players encounter are either one where players must select the right interconnected letters inside the lens of a telescope to form a coherent sentence; or a relatively simple cake puzzle, where the player has to divide the cake evenly into six pieces, each containing the same number of decorations. Other puzzles include mazes, chess problems, logical deductions, Simon -style pattern-matching, word manipulations, and a difficult game of Ataxx , similar to Reversi . For players who need help or cannot solve a particular puzzle, there is a hint book in the library of the house. The first two times the book is consulted about a puzzle, the book gives clues about how to solve the puzzle; for the third time, the book completes the puzzle for the player so that the player can proceed. After each puzzle, the player is shown a video clip of part of the plot, if the hint book was consulted three times, the player does not get to view the clip. The hint book can be used for all but the final puzzle. The game begins with a flashback to 1935 in the town of Harley-on-the-Hudson. A drifter named Henry Stauf kills a woman to steal her purse, beginning a series of deplorable acts. He has a vision of a beautiful doll, and the next day begins carving it. He trades the doll for food, drink and a place to stay at a local tavern. Stauf has other visions of dolls and toys, and crafts and sells these as well. Stauf becomes a successful toymaker. He uses his fortune to build a mansion at the edge of town, following another vision. At the same time, several children possessing Stauf's toys contract a mysterious illness and die. Stauf disappears into his mansion and is never seen again. In the game's present, the narrator (the player's character) named ""Ego"" awakens in the Stauf mansion. The mansion is deserted, but as Ego explores it, he has ghostly visions of events in the past. These visions all take place on a night sometime after the deaths of the children, where six guests were invited to the Stauf mansion: Martine Burden, a former singer; Edward and Elinor Knox, a dissatisfied middle-aged couple; Julia Heine, a bank worker who reminisces of her youth; Brian Dutton, a fellow shop owner; and Hamilton Temple, a stage magician. The six arrive but find no sign of Stauf or anyone else. They discover a number of puzzles that give them instructions. They learn that Stauf wanted them to bring him a seventh, uninvited guest: a boy named Tad who entered the house on a dare. The guests debate what to do. Elinor and Hamilton feel they must find Tad and help him escape Stauf's plan. The others search for Tad in earnest to claim their reward from Stauf. The evening becomes bloody as the guests turn on one another or become trapped by Stauf's machinations. Julia, the last survivor, drags Tad to the attic where Stauf waited for them. Having made a pact with the evil force that gave him his visions and killed the children, Stauf has transformed into a horrific creature. He needs Tad's soul to complete the pact. Stauf kills Julia and entangles Tad with a prehensile tongue. Ego realizes that he is the spirit of Tad, witnessing the events of that night over and over but previously unable to help; the house has been a purgatory for him. Ego finds he can now intervene in the events, and helps Tad to escape. Stauf is unable to recapture the child, and the evil entity consumes Stauf for failing to complete the pact. Tad thanks Ego for his help, and then Ego steps into a sphere of light and disappears. The second disc of the CD-ROM set included a single audio track playable on a CD player. In total, the track was almost half an hour long and it included both the in-game music, composed by video game musician George ""The Fat Man"" Sanger , and two live music recordings: ""The Game"", whose melody in various permutations and stylistic variations became the background music for most of the game (as well as the theme for a piano puzzle) and whose lyrics (sung on the disc by Cotton Mather vocalist Robert Harrison) were based on Stauf's twisted plot, and the ending credits theme, ""Skeletons in My Closet"", a jazzy tune with a female lead voice (Kris McKay), parts of which are used in the game as Julia's theme. A few years later, Sanger independently released an album titled 7/11 , which was a little over an hour long and contained all the music from T7G (this time, on separate tracks) as well as its sequel, The 11th Hour . Portion of Sanger's ""The Game"" leitmotif The in-game music had conventions similar to the use of leitmotif in Sergei Prokofiev 's Peter and the Wolf , wherein each guest was assigned a musical theme ; where Peter and Wolf used instrumental changes for its characters, The 7th Guest , conversely, used stylistic variations on the melody of Sanger's ""The Game"".
Where two characters interact in the story, the styles are fused , counterpointed , or even sounded simultaneously and when tension abounds, the characters' themes are reflected thusly. The 7th Guest was the brainchild of game designer / graphic artist Rob Landeros , and a Virgin Mastertronic programmer , Graeme Devine . When Landeros and Devine presented their idea for the game to Martin Alper , CEO of Virgin Games , they were promptly ""fired"" so that with Virgin's help they could start their own company, Trilobyte , dedicated solely to the development of this game. The game's POV video of walking through the house was originally planned as a live-action video in a practical set, but the idea was abandoned after pre-rendered 3D sequences proved feasible and more cost-effective. After creating the design document Devine and Landeros gave it to writer Matthew Costello . The developers chose to use 24-bit Super VGA graphics and a simple, textless, TV remote control-like user interface to make the game the answer to the question ""What would Mom play?"", and to simplify porting to game consoles such as the SNES-CD . Devine created the GROOVIE game engine , which allowed continuous streaming of data from CD-ROM, ran on multiple platforms, and was reusable. The 7th Guest was the first graphic adventure to use 640x320 graphics with 256 colors; Trilobyte reportedly spent more than $500,000 over more than two years to produce the graphics. George Sanger created the soundtrack . The developers found that, as Devine said in 1993, ""CD-ROM is bloody slow"". Early blue-screened footage was imperfect and left ghostly auras, which they left in as a feature . The puzzles they intended to use were under copyright, so the developers used puzzle books from the 19th century. Cast members' work on FMVs was different from traditional filmmaking: They performed all possible actions players chose in a game, usually looked into the camera to react to the player, and usually did not react to others on the chroma key sets. Devine said that he cried when watching the end credits play for the first time: ""It had been such a hard game to make and I was so exhausted from the process of getting it finished that seeing those credits play through made me realise what we had done"". The 7th Guest was one of the first games for the PC platform to be available only on CD-ROM , since it was too large to be distributed on floppy disks . Computer Gaming World reported in 1993, ""not only does Guest consume an entire CD-ROM ... it actually requires TWO"". Removing some of the large movies and videos was not an option, as they were essential to the gameplay . This game, along with LucasArts ' Star Wars: Rebel Assault and Broderbund 's Myst , helped promote the adoption of CD drives, which were not yet common. The PC version of the game received generally positive reviews from critics. Jim Trunzo of White Wolf stated that "" The 7th Guest is a brilliant piece of software that heralds new standards. While it isn't a perfect piece of programming, it's a great start towards that elusive goal."" Chuck Miller of Computer Gaming World was critical of the game, calling it ""a nightmare and a dream"" and stating that despite its lengthy delay, the game should have been developed further. While praising the ""rich, enjoyable gaming experience"", he found that the minimum system requirements were unrealistic and encountered stability and software incompatibility issues. Miller concluded that he felt ""deprived of the full pleasure"" of playing the game, and the testing done prior to its release was insufficient. The magazine stated in April 1994 that the game was ""consistently ranking high in our [reader] polls"", and recommended it to puzzle fans who ""want to see and hear some of the most exceptional computer graphics and music created to date"". Electronic Entertainment called it ""the first truly compelling interactive CD-ROM game"". Bill Gates called The 7th Guest ""the new standard in interactive entertainment"". The CD-i version received mostly positive reviews. GamePro ' s review lauded the ""sinister"" story line, the challenging puzzles, the graphics, and the creepy tone. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers described it as superior to any of the computer versions of the game. Like GamePro , they praised the game's puzzles, graphics, and tone. Power Unlimited gave the CD-i version a score of 70%, describing it as having ""beautiful computer graphics"" with a ""quite scary"" story and ""extremely difficult"" puzzles. Next Generation rated this version three stars out of five, and stated that ""the smooth video, crisp sound, original tracks featuring the almost famous 'FAT MAN'—combined with devilish puzzles—makes for a lavish CD-i game"". The Macintosh version of the game was reviewed by Paul Murphy in Dragon , who said: "" The Seventh Guest suffers from an incurable case of confusion about what it is trying to be. It's either a collection of puzzles encumbered by an unnecessary horror setting and story—or it's a horror story and setting encumbered by an unnecessary collection of puzzles"". The 7th Guest won Electronic Entertainment ' s 1993 ""Breakthrough Game"" award. It won the award for Best CD Computer Game at Cybermania '94 . In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the game 23rd on their Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game's atmosphere and plot. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named The 7th Guest the 82nd-best adventure game ever released. In its first year, it sold 450,000 units and earned more than $15 million. Its sales reached 500,000 units by 1994, exceeded one million copies by 1995 (higher than Myst at the time), and sold in excess of 2.3 million copies worldwide as of 1997 . It is widely regarded as a killer app that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. In July 1995, it was the best-selling game on CD-ROM, with sales of 1.5 million copies. By April 1998, The 7th Guest had sold 929,611 units and earned $40 million in revenue in the United States. This led PC Data to declare it the country's eighth-best-selling computer game for the period between January 1993 and April 1998. The 7th Guest and Myst are considered to be the killer apps that popularized CD-ROM for computer systems. Trilobyte released a sequel of The 7th Guest titled The 11th Hour in December 1995. The game's reception was initially mixed and did not sell as well as expected. Plans for further sequels to the series were initiated, but never completed due to the initial demise of the company. Landeros attempted to create his own official third installment titled The 7th Guest Part III: The Collector , releasing a trailer for the game onto his official website, only for the trailer to disappear and no further information on the series being released. Trilobyte also released a compilation game made up of the puzzles from both The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour as well as Clandestiny titled Uncle Henry's Playhouse . The game was poorly received, only selling 27 copies in the United States. Ports of both The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour were planned, with The 7th Guest being ported to the CD-i format. Initial plans for The 11th Hour to be ported to the 3DO platform eventually fell through. In 2010, the first game in the series was ported to the iPhone and iPad , with the series later also being ported to other systems such as the Macintosh. A stand-alone version of the Microscope Puzzle from the original version of The 7th Guest was later released under the name The 7th Guest: Infection . The puzzle had been excluded from the game for technical reasons and features two versions of the puzzle, a somewhat updated version of the puzzle as well as an older version of the Infection game that can be unlocked by beating the main game. In 2013, Trilobyte partnered with Night Dive Studios to re-release both The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour on Steam . Trilobyte, relaunched under Rob Landeros, started a Kickstarter campaign on Halloween 2013 for The 7th Guest 3: The Collector . However, it failed to meet its funding target of $435,000. Another crowdfunding campaign was started at Crowdtilt with a smaller goal of $65,000 to build the first story of the haunted mansion but also failed to reach the goal. In July 2015, developer Attic Door Productions, having received licensing from Trilobyte for a commercial release pending success in gaining sufficient public interest and funding, began a Kickstarter campaign for an unofficial fan game to The 7th Guest titled The 13th Doll . The campaign target was set at $40,000, running until August 27. The campaign had 1,199 backers and $60,266 was pledged. The game was released on October 31, 2019. Its story centers on a grown-up Tad, the original seventh guest of the first game, revisiting the house to face his past; Robert Hirschboeck reprised his role as Stauf. The player has the option of two playable characters to explore the house and solve puzzles. The newer game engine also allows the player to explore the house freely, moving away from the original ""on rails"" movement. Adventure Gamers gave the game 3 out 5 stars and summarized that ""While it doesn't quite rise to the level of the classic horror puzzler that inspired it, The 13th Doll is a fairly enjoyable tribute that ought to please those who spent the past two decades wanting more Stauf."" In April 2017, Trilobyte launched a Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Guest: The Board Game . The game features a Cluedo -like board design and figures representing the guests from the original PC game. Players must solve Puzzler Cards to get credit for unlocking specific rooms in the Stauf Mansion with the ultimate goal to reach the room at the top and to receive their heart's desires. In April 2019, Trilobyte and MojoTouch released the remastered 25th Anniversary Edition of the original game for Windows, replacing the previous version on Steam and GOG.com . Apart from the digitally enhanced original movie clips and sound, the release contained a completely reworked control system, a map, the possibility to skip scenes and new menus. The player can choose between the original soundtrack and MIDI or Adlib synth music, with or without ""retro"" mode (with original image, sound and controls). The release also contained a large amount of extras: three new language soundtracks and subtitles, deleted features, and behind-the-scenes clips, 36 tracks audio, a complete novel and script, along with a Making of featurette. It also included the possibility to download the original versions for Windows, macOS or Linux. The 25th Anniversary Edition is also available on Android , iOS and iPadOS . In April 2023, Trilobyte and MojoTouch released a new console edition for the Nintendo Switch , which has most of the features from the 25th Anniversary Edition while supporting all of the console game modes: TV, touch, tabletop and both Joy-Con and Pro controllers . In July 2024, the console edition was ported to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 . Vertigo Studios and Exkee developed a virtual reality version of The 7th Guest for Meta Quest , PlayStation VR2 , and Windows-based VR headsets. It was released on October 19, 2023. The game had similar story and fully explorable VR environments with new puzzles better suited for VR, and the prior full-motion video clips were replaced with newly filmed (new actors) clips using volumetric video .",Trilobyte,"April 28, 1993 DOS NA : April 28, 1993 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] EU : June 23, 1993 CD-i NA : October 1, 1993 EU : November 17, 1993 Mac OS NA : February 1994 Windows NA : 1997 EU : 1997 iOS NA : December 15, 2010 Linux WW : October 19, 2013 Android WW : April 14, 2015","DOS CD-i , Mac OS , Windows , iOS , Android , OS X , Linux , Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5",False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,,,,illness; mutation; soul,escape; locked,assault; kill; killed,,creature; evil; witch,youth,

The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Pictures%3A_Switchback_VR," The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is a rail shooter video game developed and published by Supermassive Games for the PlayStation VR2 . It was released on 16 March 2023. It is a spin-off of The Dark Pictures Anthology and features the player riding a horror-themed roller coaster . It is a spiritual sequel to the 2016 VR game Until Dawn: Rush of Blood , which was also a game released near the original PlayStation VR 's launch. The game is a spin-off from The Dark Pictures Anthology and features various locations from the four games. Much like the previous rail shooter, the player is armed with a set of pistols to shoot targets, objects and enemies, shooting boxes that give brief upgrades to their guns (semi-automatic, shotgun, etc.). In this game, particularly in the third-through-eighth levels, the player is given special items (namely the UV light, Flare Gun and Stun Gun) to aid in overcoming specific obstacles and solving puzzles/utilizing environmental mechanics. Players shoot switches on the rollercoaster track to alter course and make important decisions that will determine the player's fate. In addition, the player has to solve puzzles to save the other passengers, who can either die, be abandoned by the player, or be saved depending on how the player solves the puzzle. The characters' fates cannot be reversed should they die or be abandoned. The game is played from the perspective of a passenger on a train, who encounters a young woman before the train crashes while they listen to a voicemail from their sister, who planned on meeting up with them at an amusement park to commemorate their father's death. Heavily injured and on the verge of death, the players falls into limbo as they find themselves in a series of rail rides called ""The Inferno"" (with multiple locations correlating to previous games from the Dark Pictures series). Throughout the game they use various tricks and tools (such as the UV light, Flare Gun and Stun Gun) to progress and solve puzzles to possibly save the souls of the other passengers on the train. All the while being watched by the Curator at certain points and being taunted by a demonic entity. The game begins on the Chinese coast, where they pass through the wreckages of various ships, encountering a fellow passenger trapped in a flooding box who dies if the player is unable to stop the water flow. In the center of the SS Ourang Medan, the player defeats the ghostly Sailor Girl, even as she taps into her telekinetic powers. They next arrive in the abandoned town of Little Hope, where they face the demons of its past, and where they encounter another passenger tied to a stake who will burn alive if she isn't freed by the destruction of the ropes holding her. Entering the church, the player faces the Burned Demon to escape. In the cavernous ruined temples beneath the Akkadian Desert, the player finds themselves in the caves housing the crash site of an alien vessel, where they can choose to save a third passenger from a falling cage death trap or not (by weakening certain supports to lower it closer to a cliff). They fight the hordes of vampires and alien parasites as they reach the alien nest, eventually culminating in a standoff with The Ancient One, the Akkadian soldier Balathu, who had been turned into a vampiric creature over 4000 years ago. In the fourth area, the player enters the replica of H.H. Holmes' World's Fair Hotel, encountering scores of serial killer Granthem Du'Met's android replicas and several of his traps, some of which the player must use to hold off his minions; the player also must use the Stun Gun to hit the correct fuse boxes to save themselves and possibly another passenger in a massive room, if they choose to; the passenger will likely die from electrocution if the player guesses wrong too many times. Entering the killer's lair, they are stuck in a series of death traps from Du'Met, but the player defeats him by turning the death traps back on him, killing Du'Met. After leaving the hotel, the player is confronted by the mysterious young woman. In the final level, the player finds themselves in a Frozen Hell, where the young woman on the train reveals herself to be the demoness Belial, Mother of Lies. Depending on how the player dealt with the other train passengers (whether the player saved them or abandoned/killed them), Belial will comment on their decisions. With aid from the souls they saved (should the player choose to save them) and the use of a special spirit gun they steal from Belial, the player confronts Belial in a final battle for their soul. There are two endings, which depend on how quickly the player is able to defeat Belial in the Frozen Hell. If the player takes too long, then the player will die in the train crash and Belial will drag their soul to hell with her, with the Curator appearing behind the fireman in the train. If the player is quick enough, then they will survive the experience and escape the nightmare as Belial is banished back to hell, with the player awakening in the wreckage as a firefighter appears to save them. In February 2022, Supermassive Games filed trademarks for six potential future entries, including Switchback . Unlike previous entries of the series, it is not published by Bandai Namco Entertainment , instead being self-published by Supermassive Games.

It was developed by Ska Studios and released for the Xbox 360 via XBLA on April 6, 2011, and for the Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS on May 12, 2017. It is the sequel to The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai , released in 2009. Players assume the roles of The Dishwasher and his stepsister Yuki, in two separate solo campaigns, as they battle through legions of enemies and try to unravel the secrets of their pasts. The main story revolves around The Dishwasher's quest for universal freedom and Yuki's quest for revenge against the three marks of power that robbed her of her life. The game begins with a playable flashback segment of the first game where the player leads The Dishwasher through the Grace Chapel, building up to the boss fight against Yuki. The Dishwasher emerges victorious from this battle and Yuki dies in his hands. It is revealed that after the events of the first game, The Dishwasher and Chef destroyed the world after it became uninhabitable. This crime was pinned on Yuki however, who was witnessed escaping the scene, having mysteriously been reanimated. During her time in the Iffenhaus prison ship she experiences recurring nightmares caused by an entity known as The Creeper, and wakes up to the image of her slaughtering a prison guard. With her newfound powers she breaks out of the prison and stows herself away in an escape pod shortly after getting her arm cut off in battle. She crashes onto the Moon and wakes up, only to find herself with a chainsaw implant where her arm used to be. She then and there decides to pursue a quest for revenge against the three figures of power known as The Banker, General and Judge, all of whom were responsible for her incarceration. During this time The Dishwasher who has relocated himself to the moon finds himself searching for the heart of the new Cyborg movement, following Yuki's blood trail of revenge. The game is broken up into two solo campaigns that largely run in tandem with each other. They break off midway into separate stories once the two protagonists meet each other for the first time, however. In Yuki's storyline , she finds herself in another hallucination where she finds a knife and uses it to kill who she believes is her manipulator, The Creeper. However she regains conscious and finds out that she inadvertently has stabbed The Dishwasher with it. Yuki becomes distressed but is reassured by him that he's okay with it, as it's only fair she repays him the favor for having killed her once. The Dishwasher rips the knife out of his body and dies. The Creeper then appears before Yuki and is killed by her in a fit of rage and hate. Chef then arrives to the scene, explaining to her that killing The Dishwasher shouldn't be possible as the Chef, Dishwasher and Yuki all share the same inhuman blood that makes them unkillable through normal means. He tells Yuki that the knife she extracted from her nightmares should be taken back and used to murder her inner demon who is driving her to the brink of insanity. Yuki succeeds, and proceeds to kill her final mark, the Judge, who has become a symbiont for The Fallen Engineer. In the end after facing the fact that the world is still in chaos and that her stepbrother is dead, her only care in the world is that she's finally free. In The Dishwasher's storyline , Chef confronts him, explaining to him that Yuki is being manipulated by The Creeper, who must die if Yuki is to have her freedom. The Dishwasher finds Yuki being manipulated by The Creeper, but quickly kills The Creeper so as to not having to resort to killing Yuki again. Yuki regains conscious and finds The Dishwasher standing over The Creeper's dead body. The two then reconcile, however Yuki remains convinced that her mission for revenge is one that she must carry out alone. The Dishwasher leaves her to her mission, as he continues his search for the source of Cyborgs. He eventually reaches the Judge's tower where Yuki prepares to exact her revenge, however through an accursed mask the Judge manages to act as a symbiont for The Fallen Engineer, the true antagonist of the plot, and he partakes with The Dishwasher and Yuki in a battle. The Engineer manages to enter the depths of The Dishwasher's stagnant nightmare and tries to kill him from the inside. The Dishwasher overpowers him however, and ultimately kills him. Gameplay remains largely similar to that of its predecessor . The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up where the player must violently dispense of enemies with the help of numerous weapons. Recurring elements from the original include Dish Magic and Shop Bots where one can buy upgrades and items with money received through defeating enemies. The biggest addition is a new playable character, Yuki, who controls differently from The Dishwasher in combat. Co-op has also been fully integrated into the story-mode allowing for an exclusive campaign. There are five new weapons in the game, including a large syringe dubbed The Painkiller and an oversized pair of scissors titled The Guillotine . Combat revisions have been made: now the player can stock up to four weapons at once with the help of two sets of load outs that can be interchanged at all times. Guns are now automatically mapped to function on the right trigger, and normal enemies no longer have exclusive executions as they are all down to weaponry. A new gameplay feature is the addition of collectible Beads that can be equipped to give various status effects such as improved strength against specific enemies or attacks draining health. The guitar minigame also makes a return; however, the Psycho Picks that were granted in the original game for finishing them do not. The game was showcased at the PAX East 2010 convention. The Xbox 360 version received ""favorable"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . GameSpot ' s Kevin VanOrd said that the game was ""grimly gorgeous and violently entertaining"" and went on to say that it ""is one of the finest games released so far this year."" Destructoid , by contrast, praised the game's goofy violence, character design, bleak aesthetic, and tightly-designed combat while criticizing its convoluted story and inability to engage the player to the end. Game Informer recommended the game, writing, ""[ The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile ' s] grim style is accompanied by some of the tightest 2D action around. While the challenge and dark subject matter could be a turn-off for some, most players will find a deep and rewarding action title that is more than worth a download."" IGN said, ""This is a refined version of the first title, with better dodging, more varied and entertaining enemies, and the same over-the-top violence...The repetitive level design can become mind-numbing in any sort of prolonged session, but the excellent combat is enough to make it worth playing...""

The Evil Within 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Within_2," The Evil Within 2 is a 2017 survival horror game developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda Softworks . The game is the sequel to 2014's The Evil Within . The Evil Within 2 was released for PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One in October 2017. The game received generally positive reviews from critics; like its predecessor, it received praise for its visuals, atmosphere and gameplay, but received some criticism for its story and characters. Similar to its predecessor, The Evil Within 2 is a survival horror video game. Played from a third-person perspective or a first-person perspective , the player assumes control of detective Sebastian Castellanos, who must descend into the world of Union to rescue his daughter, Lily. There are five difficulty modes, namely Casual, which producer Shinji Mikami recommends, Survival, Nightmare, which is the setting recommended for players who enjoyed the difficulty curve in the previous game, Classic, which is mostly identical to Nightmare, but limits the number of saves and removes upgrades, and Akumu, which is also mostly identical to Nightmare, but causes the player to die in a single hit from anything. In The Evil Within 2 , maps are larger and there are multiple ways for players to advance in a level. The player is also given an item known as ""The Communicator"", which helps to highlight the objectives, resources and enemies featured in the game's world. It also reveals Resonance points, which provides hints regarding what had happened in the world of Union. Players can explore the map area freely to complete side objectives and scout for resources, which are scarce. Players can engage in direct confrontation with enemies using weapons like guns, or use stealth to prevent themselves from being noticed or sneak behind enemies to kill them silently. The game features a crafting system , in which players can gather resources to craft new items such as ammo. Players can craft items at any time in the game, but doing so in a workbench requires fewer crafting materials. A customization system is also present. The Green Gel, introduced in the first game, can be used to customize Sebastian's abilities, which are divided into five different trees: health, stealth, combat, recovery and athleticism. Weapons can be customized using the weapon parts players collected through exploring Union. In February 2018, a free update was released that added an option to play the game from a first-person perspective . Three years after the events of the first game, Sebastian Castellanos (Marqus Bobesich / Hiroyuki Kinoshita ) has left the Krimson City Police Department, haunted by his experiences at the Beacon Mental Hospital. His only child, Lily (Kiara Gamboa / Sakura Sakai), supposedly perished in their house fire, and his wife Myra (Elizabeth Saydah / Rika Fukami ), unwilling to accept her daughter's death, abandoned him. This, coupled with his trauma, results in Sebastian descending into alcoholism . Drowning his sorrows in a bar, Sebastian is approached by former partner and Mobius agent Juli Kidman (Meg Saricks / Yūko Kaida ), who reveals that Lily is still alive. Sebastian is brought to a secret Mobius facility against his will, where he meets the head of the facility named the Administrator (Richard Neil / Jin Yamanoi ). The Administrator explains that Lily is being used as the Core for a new STEM system to simulate an idyllic American town called Union. However, Mobius lost contact with Lily and their agents inside Union, and they have lost control over the simulation. Sebastian reluctantly agrees to help and is plugged into STEM. Upon entering Union, Sebastian discovers the town has turned into a nightmare realm where all of the inhabitants were either killed or mutated into monsters. In addition, Sebastian witnesses a mysterious photographer with supernatural powers hunting down and murdering Mobius operatives. He manages to find surviving Mobius personnel Liam O'Neal (Jesse LeNoir / Takuya Masumoto), Yukiko Hoffman (Ying Hsiao / Mayumi Sako ), and Julian Sykes (Hari Williams / Tōru Sakurai), who help him in the search for Lily. As Sebastian follows her trail, he learns that she has been kidnapped by the war photographer Stefano Valentini (Rafael Goldstein / Setsuji Satō ), a serial killer obsessed with photographing people at the moment of their death who managed to infiltrate Union. Stefano reveals that he had originally kidnapped Lily under orders from another party, but decided to keep her for himself to exploit her powers as the Core. Sebastian fights and kills Stefano but before he can rescue Lily, Myra appears and takes Lily away. Sebastian finds himself transported to the interior of a mysterious stronghold-like area, where he is approached by Father Theodore Wallace (Ron Sewer / Tesshō Genda ), who attempts to convince Sebastian to join him to seize Lily from Myra since Stefano betrayed him. Sebastian refuses and is banished to a forest outside Union where he meets with Mobius operative Esmeralda Torres (Crash Barrera / Tomo Muranaka ). Upon reaching her safe house, Torres reveals that she, Kidman, Myra, and Theodore had conspired to break Lily out of STEM and destroy Mobius from within via their chip implants. However, the plan went awry when Theodore became mentally unstable and decided to kidnap Lily for himself. Seeing Theodore as the most immediate threat, Sebastian goes to confront him, but is forced to kill a brainwashed Liam. Upon reaching Theodore, Sebastian is immediately incapacitated when Theodore uses Sebastian's own lingering guilt against him and he falls unconscious. Sebastian is visited by a vision of Myra, who assures him that what happened to Lily was not his fault and that he should focus on saving her. When he wakes up, he finds out that Esmeralda had sacrificed herself to get him to safety and that Theodore has erected his stronghold in the center of Union. Both Sebastian and Yukiko assault Theodore's stronghold, though Yukiko dies in the process. Sebastian is able to confront and defeat Theodore, only for Myra to arrive and kill Theodore herself while warning Sebastian to stay away from her and Lily. Sebastian follows Myra, whose desire to protect Lily has made her insane and obsessed with keeping Lily locked in the STEM for her own ""safety"". Myra lashes out at him, forcing him to shoot her, triggering her transformation into a large being called 'The Matriarch', forcing Sebastian to reluctantly battle her. Sebastian defeats the monster, releasing Myra and knocking her back to her senses. He prepares to take Lily out of STEM, but Myra refuses to follow, explaining that as part of the plan to destroy Mobius, she must take Lily's place as the Core of STEM to transmit the implant-destroying signal. Meanwhile, in the real world, Kidman is ordered by the Administrator to eliminate Sebastian. She disobeys him and helps Sebastian and Lily escape the STEM while Myra enacts her plan, killing the Administrator and all Mobius operatives (except Kidman who has removed the microchip from her brain). Now free from Mobius, Sebastian, Lily, and Kidman leave the facility. In a post-credits scene, Sebastian parts ways with Kidman and goes off to live a new life with Lily. Back at the now abandoned Mobius facility, the STEM system mysteriously reactivates itself. Development for The Evil Within 2 began in March 2015, after the team at Tango Gameworks wrapped up the development of the downloadable content for the first game. Director Shinji Mikami stepped down and became game producer and supervised the game's development. Mikami said the development period was quite a bit shorter than it had been for its predecessor. The director role was assigned to John Johanas, described by Mikami as a person with ""a lot of talent"". The story of the game was penned by Syoji Ishimine and Trent Haaga . One of their focuses was to make the game's story easier for players to comprehend and understand, a response to the criticism of the first game where the game's plot gets too complicated by the end. Shifting realities, a feature in the first game, also returns in the sequel but according to Johanas, ""there's a bit more logic to when and how it happens"". The 2.5:1 aspect ratio featured in the first game was removed due to the mixed response this design choice had received upon its release, even though the team liked it. While the game retains the gore-horror featured prominently in the original game, the writing team also put effort into creating the game's psychological horror aspect, as the game tells a story that is more personal. Unlike its predecessor, which ran on id Software 's id Tech 5 engine, The Evil Within 2 runs on the STEM engine, an offshoot of id Tech that was custom developed by Tango Gameworks for the game. In August 2016, Pete Hines, an executive from publisher Bethesda Softworks , revealed that The Evil Within had sold enough copies to warrant a sequel, though he declined to comment on whether a new game is in development. The Evil Within 2 was leaked in March 2017, in which a job description for Psycho Break 2 , the game's Japanese title, was leaked. An advertisement for the game was prematurely posted on Reddit , several hours prior to the game's official announcement at Bethesda's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 press conference. The Evil Within 2 was released for PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One on October 13, 2017. The Evil Within 2 received ""generally favorable"" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic . Ray Porreca's score of 7/10 on Destructoid said it was ""Solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun."" Mollie L Patterson said in Electronic Gaming Monthly : ""Though I never expected to ever see a sequel to The Evil Within , we've now gotten one, and I'm rather glad that we did. While The Evil Within 2 isn't without problems—and I'm not sure it's the kind of game I'll ever want to play through a second time—by the time the final credits rolled, I had legitimately enjoyed the adventure I'd just gone on, and the improvements that Tango Gameworks had tried to bring to the series."" Game Informer ' s Suriel Vazquez awarded the game a 7.75/10, stating: "" The Evil Within 2 is a solid horror game that expands the scope of the series to extend out of the shadow of a titan in the horror genre, even if it sometimes leans heavily on borrowed ideas. Its progression and difficulty curve create a satisfying loop that repays resourcefulness and strategy, but its set pieces and structure don't build enough on the many ideas they borrow to make them feel new or interesting. The result is a ride that offers some fun thrills in the moment, but I don't think I'll lose too much sleep over these particular nightmares."" Paul Tamburro of Game Revolution awarded it 3.5 out of 5 stars stating that "" The Evil Within 2 is a worthy sequel that makes a number of bold decisions. For those solely looking for the survival horror thrills of the first game, its spotlight upon combat will likely be a disappointment, as will its introduction of a dull open world. However, there's plenty tucked away in The Evil Within 2 that will appeal to both fans of the original and new players, with it presenting a mix of Mikami's best ideas and John Johanas' new direction. It's certainly not what I was expecting, but in a good way."" Alessandro Fillari's 8/10 score on GameSpot stated: ""Though there's some occasional technical hiccups that result in some particularly frustrating moments and weird pacing issues, this horror sequel elevates the tense and impactful survival horror experience in ways that feel fresh and exciting. What this cerebral horror game does isn't totally new, but it rarely feels routine, and offers plenty of surprises. Coming in at a lengthy and surprisingly packed 15-hour campaign, the sequel does an admirable job of ratcheting up the tension and scares when it needs to, while also giving you the freedom to explore and proceed how you want. It's a tough thing to balance, but The Evil Within 2 does it remarkably well, and in a way that leaves a strong and lasting impression after its touching conclusion."" Lucas Sullivan from GamesRadar gave the game a score of 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that ""Though it doesn't outdo its predecessor, The Evil Within 2 delivers another fun, challenging, tense horror headtrip that should delight fans of the first game."" Lucy O'Brien of IGN gave the game 8/10, concluding that "" The Evil Within 2 is an intense and exhilarating survival horror experience."" 80/100 was Joe Donnelly's score on PC Gamer and said it was ""An intense and thrilling psychological survival horror sequel that improves on its forerunner in almost every way."" "" The Evil Within 2 represents one of the starkest and most astounding turnarounds from a debut title to its sequel that I've ever witnessed. It's a brilliant horror game, one that understands when to ratchet up tension and when to pull back and let you collect yourself. If the first game was a failed attempt to capture the spirit of Shinji Mikami's classic Resident Evil 4 , the sequel is a successful attempt at something much better: finding a chilling, exhilarating voice of its own,"" was Philip Kollar's conclusion on Polygon with a score of 9/10. The website later ranked the game 21st on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. In Japan, The Evil Within 2 sold 42,941 units on PlayStation 4 within its first week on sale, which placed it at number three on the all-format sales chart. The game was nominated for ""Best Action Game"" in PC Gamer ' s 2017 Game of the Year Awards, for ""Best Action-Adventure Game"" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. and for ""Game, Franchise Action"" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.",Tango Gameworks,"WW : October 13, 2017 JP : October 19, 2017",PlayStation 4 Windows Xbox One,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,daughter,father; wife,trauma,mutated,escape; kidnapped; locked,assault; kill; killed; murder,forced,evil; monster,,
The Last of Us,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_%28video_game%29," The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment . Players control Joel , a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie , across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective . Players use firearms, improvised weapons , and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus . In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. The game's development began in 2009 after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves . The studio split into two teams for the first time, with one developing The Last of Us while the other worked on Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception . Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through voice and motion capture , and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with developing the characters and story; Joel and Ellie's relationship became the focus of development, with all other elements crafted around it. The score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla . The Last of Us was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 to acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, score, characterization , depiction of violence, and portrayal of female characters. It became one of the best-selling video games, selling over 1.3 million copies in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. Its year-end accolades include Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications and awards ceremonies. It is considered one of seventh-generation console gaming 's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made . Naughty Dog released several downloadable content additions; The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. A remastered version, The Last of Us Remastered , was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2014, and a remake, The Last of Us Part I , was released for the PlayStation 5 in 2022 and on Windows in 2023. A sequel, The Last of Us Part II , was released in 2020. Other The Last of Us media includes a comic book in 2013, a live show in 2014, a television adaptation by HBO in 2023, and a tabletop game by Themeborne in 2024. The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective . The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons , hand-to-hand combat , and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel , a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie , across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment and briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits , shivs , and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits. Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. ""Listen Mode"" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system , the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu. The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance and can take advantage of the player being distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies. The online multiplayer mode, called Factions, allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in rearranged versions of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches , with the latter excluding the ability to respawn ; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's lockbox and the first to capture said lockbox wins. In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve ""weeks"", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction. Players earn ""parts"" by marking or killing enemies, healing or reviving allies, crafting items, and unlocking the enemy lockbox. Parts can be spent mid-match on weapon upgrades and armor and are converted to supplies at the end of the match; additional supplies can be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players also earn points as they play, which can be spent on weapons or skills to create custom loadouts. Players could originally connect the game to their Facebook account, altering clan members' names and faces to match their Facebook friends . Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems. The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019. In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus spread through bites and airborne spores ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas , Joel ( Troy Baker ) flees the chaos with his brother, Tommy ( Jeffrey Pierce ), and daughter, Sarah ( Hana Hayes ). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been destroyed by the infection. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner, Tess ( Annie Wersching ), in a quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts . They hunt down Robert ( Robin Atkin Downes ), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache he traded with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the Federal Disaster Response Agency (FEDRA), an organization which controls the quarantine zone. Its leader, Marlene ( Merle Dandridge ), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a fourteen-year-old girl, Ellie ( Ashley Johnson ), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House . Joel and Tess discover Ellie is infected; she claims she is immune and may be able to help develop a cure. At the State House, they discover the Fireflies have been killed and Tess reveals she has been infected during their journey. Believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope he can locate others. With the help of Bill ( W. Earl Brown ), a smuggler and survivalist in Lincoln, Massachusetts , Joel and Ellie acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry ( Brandon Scott ) and Sam ( Nadji Jeter ). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life out of grief. In the fall, Joel and Ellie find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming , where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife, Maria ( Ashley Scott ). Joel unsuccessfully leaves Ellie with Tommy, ending in a confrontation about Sarah. Tommy directs them to a Firefly enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. There, they discover the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah . The two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely wounded while escaping. During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Ellie encounters David ( Nolan North ) and James ( Reuben Langdon ), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. After David reveals the university bandits were part of his group, Ellie becomes hostile. She leads David's group away from Joel but is captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Ellie escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just as she hacks David to death with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee. In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning before a Firefly patrol captures them. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hopes of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room and kills the lead surgeon. Joel carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage, where he is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots dead to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On their way back to Tommy, when Ellie wakes up, Joel lies and tells her that the Fireflies had found other immune people but were unable to create a cure and have stopped trying. Ellie later expresses her survivor guilt . At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true. Naughty Dog began developing The Last of Us in 2009, following the release of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves . For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), the other began work on The Last of Us . Game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the team responsible for developing The Last of Us . While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of George A. Romero 's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us . Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming-of-age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child. A major motif of the game is that ""life goes on""; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to ""reignite [Ellie's] lust for life"" after her suffering following her encounter with David. The infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, as well as the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Following comparisons to actor Elliot Page , Ellie's appearance was redesigned to better reflect Johnson's personality and make her younger. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality. The Last of Us features an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla . Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some that he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the infected was one of the first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress Misty Lee , who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the ""back of the throat"". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as Robert Polidori 's photographs following Hurricane Katrina , which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's San Diego Studio . The Last of Us game designer Ricky Cambier cited the video games Ico and Resident Evil 4 as influences on the game design. He said the emotional weight of the relationship needed to be balanced with the tension of the world's issues, stating that they ""wanted to take the character building and interaction"" of Ico and ""blend it with the tension and action of Resident Evil 4 "". The team created new engines to satisfy their needs for the game. The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light , in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development. The Last of Us was announced on December 10, 2011, at the Spike Video Game Awards , alongside its debut trailer. The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which journalists ascribed to Naughty Dog's reputation. The game missed its original projected release date of May 7, 2013, and was pushed to June 14, 2013, worldwide for further polishing. To promote pre-order sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide special editions of the game with extra content. Downloadable content (DLC) for the game was released following its launch. The game's season pass includes access to all DLC, some additional abilities, and the documentary Grounded: Making The Last of Us ; the documentary was released online in February 2014. Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. The Sights and Sounds Pack included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 home screen , and two avatars . The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points and early access to customizable items for the game's multiplayer. Abandoned Territories Map Pack , released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story. Nightmare Bundle , released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately. The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign that features two storylines—one set after the prologue of The Last of Us and one before the Winter chapter —following Ellie and her friend Riley. It was released on February 14, 2014, as DLC and on May 12, 2015, as a standalone expansion pack . A third bundle was released on May 6, 2014, featuring five separate DLC: Grounded added a new difficulty to the main game and Left Behind ; Reclaimed Territories Map Pack added new multiplayer maps; Professional Survival Skills Bundle and Situational Survival Skills Bundle added eight new multiplayer skills; and Survivalist Weapon Bundle added four new weapons. The Grit and Gear Bundle , which added new headgear items, masks and gestures, was released on August 5, 2014. A Game of the Year Edition containing all downloadable content was released in Europe on November 11, 2014. On April 9, 2014, Sony Computer Entertainment announced The Last of Us Remastered , a remastered version of the game for the PlayStation 4 . It was released in July and August 2014. Remastered uses the DualShock 4 's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from green to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players have the ability to watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring Druckmann, Baker, and Johnson. Remastered features improved graphics and rendering upgrades, including increased draw distance , a higher frame rate , and advanced audio options. It includes the previously released downloadable content, including Left Behind and some multiplayer maps. The development team aimed to create a ""true"" remaster, maintaining the ""core experience"". The Last of Us Part I , a remake of The Last of Us , was released for PlayStation 5 on September 2, 2022, and for Windows on March 28, 2023. It features revised gameplay and controls, improved performance and lighting effects, and new accessibility options. On PlayStation 5, the game supports 3D audio , as well as the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller. Development of The Last of Us Part I was led by game director Matthew Gallant and creative director Shaun Escayg. The game was completely rebuilt to take advantage of the updated PlayStation 5 hardware, requiring new art direction, animation, and character models. The technological and graphical enhancements were intended to align with the vision of the original game's development team. Escayg wanted each element to make the player feel grounded and immersed in the game world. Gallant collaborated with a specialized team at Descriptive Video Works to create audio descriptions for cutscenes. Reactions to the remake's announcement were mixed, with some journalists and players considering it unnecessary due to the age of the original and the existence of Remastered , as well as questioning its US$70 price point. Upon release, the game received positive reviews, though response to the Windows version was mixed, becoming Naughty Dog's lowest-rated game. The Last of Us received ""universal acclaim"", according to review aggregator Metacritic . It is the fifth-highest-rated PlayStation 3 game on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the character development, story and subtext , visual and sound design, and depiction of female and LGBT characters. Colin Moriarty of IGN called The Last of Us ""a masterpiece"" and ""PlayStation 3's best exclusive"", and Edge considered it ""the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic"" of the console generation. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer wrote that it is ""a beacon of hope"" for the survival horror genre; Andy Kelly of Computer and Video Games declared it ""Naughty Dog's finest moment"". Kelly of Computer and Video Games found the story memorable, and IGN ' s Moriarty named it one of the game's standout features. PlayStation Official Magazine 's David Meikleham wrote that the pacing contributed to the improvement of the story, stating that there is ""a real sense of time elapsed and journey traveled along every step of the way"", and Destructoid ' s James Stephanie Sterling lauded the game's suspenseful moments. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq found that the narrative improved the character relationships. The characters—particularly the relationship between Joel and Ellie—received acclaim. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the relationship felt identifiable, naming it ""poignant"" and ""well drawn"". Eurogamer ' s Welsh wrote that the characters were developed with ""real patience and skill"", appreciating their emotional value, and Joystiq 's Mitchell found the relationship ""genuine"" and emotional. PlayStation Official Magazine ' s Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters of any PlayStation 3 game, while IGN ' s Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Kelly of Computer and Video Games named the characters ""richly painted"", feeling invested in their stories. Philip Kollar of Polygon felt that Ellie was believable, making it easier to develop a connection to her, and that the relationship between the characters was assisted by the game's optional conversations. PlayStation Official Magazine ' s Meikleham found Ellie's idle animations interacting with the environment made her a convincing teenager. The performances also received praise, with Edge and Eurogamer ' s Welsh noting that the script improved as a result. Many reviewers found the game's combat a refreshing difference from other games. Game Informer ' s Helgeson and PlayStation Official Magazine ' s Meikleham appreciated the vulnerability during fights, while Kelly of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the variety in approaching the combat. IGN ' s Moriarty felt that the crafting system assisted the combat and that the latter contributed to the narrative's emotional value, adding that enemies feel ""human"". Joystiq ' s Mitchell reiterated similar comments, stating that the combat ""piles death upon death on Joel's hands"". Welsh of Eurogamer found the suspenseful and threatening encounters added positively to the gameplay. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot wrote that the artificial intelligence negatively affected the combat, with enemies often ignoring players' companions. Polygon ' s Kollar also felt that the combat was unfair, especially when fighting the infected, and noted some inconsistencies in the game's artificial intelligence that ""shatters the atmosphere"" of the characters. The game's visual features were commended by many reviewers. The art design was lauded as ""outstanding"" by Computer and Video Games ' s Kelly, and ""jaw-dropping"" by Eurogamer ' s Welsh. In contrast, Mc Shea of GameSpot identified the visual representation of the post-apocalyptic world was ""mundane"", having been portrayed various times previously. The game's graphics have been frequently named by critics as the best for a PlayStation 3 game, with Helgeson of Game Informer naming them ""unmatched in console gaming"" and Moriarty of IGN stating that they contribute to the realism. Destructoid ' s Sterling wrote that the game was visually impressive but that technical issues, such as some ""muddy and basic"" textures found early in the game, left a negative impact on the visuals. The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that the environments are ""large, detailed, and littered with secrets"", adding that The Last of Us ""masks"" its linearity successfully. Edge repeated similar remarks, writing that the level design serves the story appropriately. Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the world ""effectively and gorgeously [conveys] the loneliness"" of the story. IGN ' s Moriarty appreciated the added design elements placed around the game world, such as the hidden notes and letters. The plausibility of the infection was commended by Scientific American ' s Kyle Hill . Reviewers praised the use of sound in The Last of Us . Eurogamer ' s Welsh felt that the sound design was significantly better than in other games, while Game Informer ' s Helgeson dubbed it ""amazing"". Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added to the effect of the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies. Kelly of Computer and Video Games found that the environmental audio positively impacted gameplay and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was ""sparse and delicate"". Both Game Informer ' s Helgeson and Destructoid 's Sterling called the score ""haunting"", with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay. The graphic depiction of violence in The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was ""a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety"", as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotaku ' s Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was ""heavy, consequential and necessary"", as opposed to gratuitous. USgamer ' s Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the ""incredibly brutal"" combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. PlayStation Official Magazine ' s Meikleham echoed remarks that the violence was not gratuitous, instead serving to ""convincingly sell"" the game's atmosphere. Eurogamer ' s Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not ""desensitized or mindless"". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq ' s Mitchell wrote that the violence is ""designed to be uncomfortable"", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it ""offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames"". Eurogamer ' s Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as ""sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a cliché"". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a ""damsel in distress"", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpot ' s Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated ""based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games"". Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times acknowledged that Ellie is a likable and ""sometimes powerful"" character, but argued that The Last of Us is ""actually the story of Joel"", stating that it is ""another video game by men, for men and about men"". The Last of Us was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality ""added to his character ... without really tokenizing him"". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the ""most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013"", calling him ""deeply flawed but wholly unique"". A kiss between two female characters in Left Behind was met with positive reactions. The Last of Us Remastered received ""universal acclaim"" according to Metacritic. It is the third-highest-rated PlayStation 4 game on Metacritic, tied with Persona 5 Royal and behind Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 . Critics praised the improved graphics, technical enhancements, controls adjustments, the inclusion of Left Behind , and the addition of Photo Mode and audio commentary. Polygon ' s Kollar compared it to a director's cut home media release, and The Escapist ' s Sterling called it ""the definitive version of the game"". The Telegraph ' s Tom Hoggins considered the enhancements minimal but understandable, considering the original game's high quality. Prior to its release, The Last of Us received numerous awards for its previews at E3 . It was review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings's second-highest rated for the year 2013, behind Grand Theft Auto V .

The Last of Us was added to the World Video Game Hall of Fame at the Strong National Museum of Play in May 2023. The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival , released by Virtual Global Games for Nintendo Switch in June 2023, was labeled a ""clone"" and ""rip-off"" of The Last of Us by journalists due to its similar concept, characters, and music; its trailers were removed from YouTube after a copyright claim from Sony and the game was removed from the Nintendo eShop in August. The Last of Us spawned a media franchise. A four-issue comic book miniseries, The Last of Us: American Dreams , was published by Dark Horse Comics from April to July 2013, written by Druckmann and illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks .

The Last of Us Part II,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II,"This is an accepted version of this page  The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment . Set four years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie , who sets out in revenge for Joel 's murder, and Abby , a soldier who killed Joel and becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The game uses a third-person perspective ; the player must fight human enemies and zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons , and stealth . The game's development began in 2014, after the release of The Last of Us Remastered . Neil Druckmann returned as creative director , co-writing the story with Halley Gross . The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel . Ashley Johnson reprises her role as Ellie, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby. Their performances included the simultaneous recording of motion and voice . Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the score . The developers pushed the PlayStation 4 's technical capabilities. Development reportedly included a crunch schedule of 12-hour workdays and cost around US$220 million , making it one of the most expensive video games to develop . Following delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic , The Last of Us Part II was released for the PlayStation 4 in June 2020. A remastered version was released for the PlayStation 5 in January 2024 and for Windows in April 2025. Part II received acclaim for its gameplay, audio design, score, performances, characters , and visual fidelity, though its narrative and themes divided critics. Discourse became adversarial and the game was review bombed on Metacritic , with some players criticizing the story and characters. It is one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games and the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, with over four million units sold in its release weekend and ten million by 2022. It won multiple accolades from awards shows and gaming publications , including 326 Game of the Year awards . The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring elements of the survival horror genre. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons , and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby ; the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat. The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies. Some areas are navigated by horse or boat. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons such as rifles and bows, and short-range weapons such as pistols and revolvers. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons such as machetes and hammers, and throw bricks and bottles to distract or attack enemies. Collected items can be used to upgrade weapons at workbenches or craft equipment such as health kits, Molotov cocktails , and makeshift silencers . The player can collect supplements to upgrade skills in a skill tree ; training manuals found throughout the environment unlock additional skill tree branches, allowing upgrades to attributes such as the health meter , crafting speed, and ammunition types. Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak past them. ""Listen Mode"" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the cover system , the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain advantages in combat, and can also crawl in a prone position to evade enemies. Hostile enemies use artificial intelligence ; they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage when the player is distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. The player may be impaled by an arrow, which will progressively decrease their health meter and disables Listen Mode until removed when in cover. Player companions, such as Dina, assist in combat by killing enemies or announcing their location. The game introduces guard dogs that track the player's scent, which can be visualized in Listen Mode. Joel ( Troy Baker ) confesses to his brother, Tommy ( Jeffrey Pierce ), his responsibility in preventing the Fireflies' attempt to develop a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie ( Ashley Johnson ) from a non-survivable surgical procedure. Four years later, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming , though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby ( Laura Bailey ), from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost used as a temporary hideout by Abby's group, former Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington . The group attacks Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father ( Derek Phillips ), the Firefly surgeon who was to operate on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend, Dina ( Shannon Woodward ), search for the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF outpost and witnesses Abby beat Joel to death. Abby spares Ellie and Tommy, who swear revenge. Tommy sets out for Seattle to hunt Abby, and Ellie and Dina follow him. In Seattle, Ellie reveals her immunity; Dina, in turn, reveals that she is pregnant. The next day, Ellie pursues Tommy alone and encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who had followed them. While searching for Abby's friend Nora ( Chelsea Tavares ), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a religious cult locked in a battle with the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on Abby's location, an act that traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the pregnant Mel ( Ashly Burch ) and her boyfriend, Owen ( Patrick Fugit ). A flashback reveals that, two years earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she cut ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy hostage. Three days earlier, Abby learns from WLF leader Isaac ( Jeffrey Wright ) that Owen, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating Seraphite activity. Abby searches for Owen and is captured by Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara (Victoria Grace) and Lev ( Ian Alexander ), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev defied Seraphite traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen, who, disillusioned with the war, plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California , where Fireflies may be regrouping. Abby returns to rescue Yara and Lev and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical supplies so Mel can amputate Yara's crippled arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to the Seraphite home island to convince his devout mother to abandon the cult. Abby and Yara find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev has killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flees as the WLF mounts an invasion of the island. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara kills Isaac, sacrificing herself to allow Abby and Lev to escape. The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead, along with a map leading to Ellie's hideout. After killing Jesse, an enraged Abby shoots Tommy in the head and severely beats Ellie and Dina. At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them and demands they leave Seattle. Several months later, Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse's son, though Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress . Having survived his injuries, Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts. Though initially hesitant, Ellie leaves to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies, who they discover are regrouping at Catalina Island, California , but are captured, tortured, and left to die by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the pair. Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie overpowers and nearly drowns Abby but has a change of heart after having a flashback of Joel and ultimately spares her. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the abandoned farmhouse. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation with Joel in which she expressed her willingness to forgive him, and leaves. Early story concepts for The Last of Us Part II were conceived during the development of The Last of Us in 2013. Naughty Dog began development in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered . By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy , the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II . Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016). Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II , overseeing gameplay elements such as level design and mechanics. For the final months of development, due to the COVID-19 pandemic , the team operated via remote work arrangements. In total, approximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on the game. According to documents from publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment , the 70-month development peaked at 200 full-time employees and cost around US$220 million , making it one of the most expensive video games to develop . Druckmann wrote the story with Halley Gross . The team experimented with different plot structures and considered scrapping the project until they settled on an idea that mirrored the first game; Druckmann said that whereas The Last of Us is about the extreme measures one would take for love, Part II is more about how far one would go to bring justice for those they love. The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel , where violence was a frequent topic. He recalled watching footage of the 2000 Ramallah lynching , and how, after hearing the cheering crowds, his mind turned to violent thoughts about bringing the perpetrators to justice. He wanted the player to feel a ""thirst for revenge"" before making them realize the reality of their actions. Druckmann said other themes include tribalism , trauma, and the pursuit of justice. Artists at Naughty Dog traveled to Seattle to analyze the architecture, vegetation, materials, topography, lighting, and capture photorealistic textures. Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby. The actors' performances were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los Angeles using performance capture , recording motion and voice simultaneously. Gross noted that a goal of the writers was to ""create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games"". She particularly wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities. The change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy. Druckmann wanted the player to hate Abby early in the game, but later empathize with her. The developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 when creating Part II , adding more enemies and larger environments than in previous games. Druckmann noted that any drops in detail would ruin the sense of authenticity, which required consistent optimization of the technology. Improved artificial intelligence (AI) allowed for deeper connections with characters and the creation of bonds through gameplay. The Last of Us Part II was originally planned as an open world game with hub worlds , but later the game transferred to a more linear style as it better served the narrative. Naughty Dog wanted to increase the accessibility options introduced in Uncharted 4 to ensure that all players could complete the story, and the developers attended conferences and worked with advocates. Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the game's score , as he had done with the first game , while Mac Quayle contributed combat music. The developers received permission to use the songs ""Future Days"" by Pearl Jam and "" Take On Me "" by A-ha . To achieve the sound of the Shamblers, the team hired voice actors Raul Ceballos and Steve Blum , and used items such as grapefruits to create the explosion sounds. The dialogue team referenced whistled languages such as Sfryria and Silbo Gomero for the Seraphites' whistling, and hired actors Stevie Mack and Lisa Marie to provide the whistles in three styles. According to a report by Kotaku ' s Jason Schreier , the development included a crunch schedule of 12-hour work days. This continued after the game was delayed. Schreier suggested that development was slowed due to the enormous turnover of employees following the development of Uncharted 4 , with few veterans left on the team. Some of the developers allegedly hoped that Part II would fail and prove that the working conditions were not viable. Sony granted Naughty Dog an additional two weeks of development for bug fixes . Druckmann felt that he had failed to find the correct balance for employees on Part II , and said the studio would receive external assistance for future projects. The Last of Us Part II was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016. At E3 2018 , Druckmann said that Naughty Dog was refusing to announce a release date until the game was ""very close to release"", to avoid disappointing fans. During Sony's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2019, Naughty Dog announced a release date of February 21, 2020. On October 25, Druckmann announced a delay to May 29, 2020, to ""bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality"". On April 2, 2020, Sony announced that the game was almost complete but had been indefinitely delayed due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . In late April, several videos leaked online, showing cutscenes, gameplay, and significant plot details. Druckmann tweeted that he was ""heartbroken"" for fans and for the team, who had devoted years to development. On April 27, Sony announced a release date of June 19, 2020. The first trailer was released alongside the announcement, showcasing the return of Ellie and Joel. The second trailer, released in October 2017 as a part of Paris Games Week , revealed Abby, Yara, and Lev. Dina and Jesse were first shown in a presentation at E3 2018. A trailer was featured in Sony's State of Play presentation in September 2019, which preceded additional marketing to celebrate Outbreak Week—the week in which the fictional outbreak occurred in the original game. A story trailer was released on May 6, followed by an animated commercial on June 3, and the final pre-launch trailer on June 10. Naughty Dog replaced and altered characters in the trailers to conceal story events; Druckmann cited the marketing of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which concealed its protagonist in trailers, as an influence. Naughty Dog announced the special edition versions in September 2019. The game was featured in its own standalone State of Play presentation on May 27. From May 13 to June 3, Naughty Dog released a series of videos about the development. The game was banned in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , attributed to its depiction of LGBTQ characters not aligning with the countries' discriminatory practices against homosexuality . An update on August 13 added a permadeath mode, a new difficulty level, and gameplay modifiers. For The Last of Us Day in September 2020, Naughty Dog announced new merchandise for the game, including a vinyl soundtrack , board game, statues, and posters. A performance update was released on May 19, 2021, allowing gameplay at 60 frames per second on the PlayStation 5 . A 120-minute documentary about the game's development, Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II , was released on February 2, 2024. In November 2023, following a PlayStation Store listing leak, Naughty Dog announced a remastered version of the game, titled The Last of Us Part II Remastered . It was released for the PlayStation 5 on January 19, 2024; existing owners can purchase the game digitally for US$10 . A special edition version, including a SteelBook case, trading cards, patch , and pins , was made available in some regions. Remastered features visual improvements, faster loading times, DualSense integration, audio description , a speedrun -focused mode, and an audio commentary for cutscenes featuring Druckmann, Gross, Johnson, Baker, Bailey, and Woodward. Some journalists and players questioned whether the game needed a remaster within four years of its initial release, though others felt it was justified by the additions and price point. New gameplay modes include Guitar Free Play, featuring playable characters Ellie, Joel, and Gustavo (modeled after Santaolalla) in several locations with unlockable guitars like Gustavo's banjo ; Lost Levels, featuring three scrapped and incomplete gameplay sequences with an introduction by Druckmann and commentary by designers Pete Ellis and Banun Idris; and No Return, a roguelike survival mode featuring randomized combat encounters. No Return features twelve playable characters with unique traits and tracked challenges, which can be completed to unlock skins and gameplay modifications. Each run in No Return features five encounters and a boss fight . Encounters consist of four gameplay types, including fighting waves of enemies, capturing a guarded safe, and defending a friend. Upgrades, items, and weapons collected during runs are lost upon completion or failure. Remastered was updated in October 2024 to target higher resolutions and frame rates on the PlayStation 5 Pro . At the Game Awards in December 2024, Naughty Dog announced the game's Windows version, developed in collaboration with Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy ; new content was added to the PlayStation 5 version in tandem with the Windows release on April 3, 2025. The Last of Us Complete —a bundle featuring The Last of Us Part I and Part II Remastered —was released digitally on April 10, 2025, followed by a physical collector's edition on July 10, featuring a SteelBook case, art prints, and a new print of the comic series The Last of Us: American Dreams . A July 2025 update added a chronological mode, intertwining Ellie and Abby's stories, as well as skins for Joel and Tommy based on Uncharted 4 ' s Nathan and Sam Drake , respectively. The Last of Us Part II received ""universal acclaim"" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic . OpenCritic 's consensus called it ""another masterpiece from Naughty Dog"" and ""a brutal, poignant, beautiful, and thrilling experience"", with 95% of critics recommending the game. IGN ' s Jonathon Dornbush called it ""a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor"", noting, atop its improved gameplay, it ""still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit"". Game Informer ' s Andy McNamara called it ""the best narrative game I have played"" and ""a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights"". Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it ""made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever"". GameSpot ' s Kallie Plagge called it ""beautiful and devastating"", and wrote ""the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core"". Game Informer ' s McNamara felt that the writers conveyed the themes of emotions ""with careful nuance and unflinching emotion"". Destructoid ' s Chris Carter and VG247 ' s Kirk McKeand applauded the use of minor dialogue to echo the themes. Sammy Barker of Push Square particularly praised the use of flashback and overlapping stories; The Guardian ' s Keza MacDonald concurred, describing the narrative as ""emotionally effective"". Conversely, GameRevolution ' s Michael Leri thought that the flashbacks were evidence of pacing problems. Alex Avard of GamesRadar+ felt that the narrative lost its momentum during its need to finalize every story thread. USgamer ' s Kat Bailey found the latter half slow, and that the game was five hours ""too long"". Bailey also criticized the dissonance between the statement against violence and its necessity during gameplay. Polygon ' s Maddy Myers and Kotaku ' s Riley MacLeod wrote that the game repeatedly delivered its themes without allowing the player any agency in their decisions. Rob Zacny of Vice wrote that, despite the amount of narrative moments, ""it doesn't have much to say"". Also writing for Vice , Emanuel Maiberg drew parallels between the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the WLF and Seraphites, and argued this was poorly considered for its allegorical representation of two equal sides. McKeand of VG247 described every character as ""complex and human"". Destructoid ' s Carter felt empathetic to the main characters, a sentiment echoed by IGN ' s Dornbush, who found Ellie's development particularly ""riveting"". Andrew Webster of The Verge praised the relationship between Ellie and Dina, though noted some dissonance in Ellie's behavior between gameplay and cutscenes. GameSpot ' s Plagge wrote that Abby's characterization led to a deeper connection to her than to Ellie, but found her character development incongruous with her ""onslaught of combat against human enemies"". Kotaku ' s MacLeod and VentureBeat ' s Dean Takahashi appreciated the diversity of characters; Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the representation of female and LGBT characters, calling it ""a game about women"", and The Spinoff ' s Sam Brooks called it ""a masterclass in how gaming can do inclusivity"". NPR ' s Kline lauded the game's ability to ""connect with every character, not just the main characters"". Push Square ' s Barker wrote that the supporting characters ""establish themselves extremely swiftly"", and Game Informer ' s McNamara found their occasional absence alarming, having grown close to them. Conversely, some critics felt that the new supporting characters lacked the higher quality of the main characters and of Naughty Dog's previous work; Yannick Le Fur of Jeuxvideo.com wrote that characters such as Jesse and Manny were simply used to advance the narrative. Polygon ' s Myers and Vice ' s Zacny criticized the characters' inability to learn from their mistakes. Critics praised the cast's performances, particularly those of Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey. Welsh of Eurogamer found Johnson's performance as Ellie to be ""standout"" due to her depiction of ""rawness, vulnerability, and rage"". GamesRadar+ ' s Avard considered Johnson's portrayal of suffering ""nothing short of awards worthy"", and found that Baker ""steals some of Part 2 ' s best scenes as Joel"" by adding complexities that enrich the character and relationships. Dornbush of IGN wrote that Johnson added nuance to every element of Ellie, and commended Woodward's performance as Dina, especially during quieter moments. VG247 ' s McKeand found that the performances made the narrative more powerful. GamesRadar+ ' s Avard praised the care and authenticity with which gameplay mechanics were introduced, on par with Naughty Dog's reputation. GameRevolution ' s Leri lauded the cohesiveness of gameplay and narrative, and their ability to create empathy. GameSpot ' s Plagge appreciated the combat's intensity and the fluidity of Ellie's movements, and VentureBeat ' s Takahashi found the combat more diverse than the first game's. IGN ' s Dornbush felt combat gameplay and puzzles had been improved, praising the enemies' intelligence and variation. GamesRadar+ ' s Avard described the enemy AI as ""some of the most advanced"" of any game. VG247 ' s McKeand considered the level design better than other Naughty Dog games, and Game Informer ' s McNamara felt it improved combat scenarios. The Verge ' s Webster admired the action but noted some ""awkward moments when [it] attempts to cover its video game-ness"". Polygon ' s Myers found the combat an unsubtle messenger for the game's statement on violence; Kotaku ' s MacLeod thought its pacing ""sometimes felt like punishment"". Critics praised the game's ""unprecedented"" accessibility options; Polygon ' s Stephen Wilds called them ""an amazing gift"", even for players who do not require them, and The Spinoff ' s Brooks felt they set a new bar for the medium. Many critics felt the graphics were among the best of any PlayStation 4 game. Kotaku ' s MacLeod wrote that the nature in Seattle is ""gorgeous and awe-inspiring"", and Push Square ' s Barker declared the art department ""among the best in the industry"". The Guardian ' s MacDonald described the graphics as ""meticulous and astounding"". Dornbush of IGN appreciated the world's ability to tell additional stories. GameRevolution ' s Leri considered the environments more realistic than the first game's, and praised the technical elements, such as frame rate , lack of load times, and realistic lighting. Carter of Destructoid felt that the seamless animation of minor facial expressions humanized the characters to a new level. McNamara of Game Informer similarly lauded the realistic-looking characters. VentureBeat ' s Takahashi commended the improvements to Naughty Dog's already impressive engine . Zacny of Vice found Seattle too similar to Boston and Pittsburgh from the first game, and Christopher Byrd of The Washington Post wondered if the detail was worth the ""human cost"" of Naughty Dog's crunch culture. Barker of Push Square described the sound design as ""stunning"", identifying the 3D audio as a technical feat he would not have expected until PlayStation 5. Vice ' s Zacny found that the audio design made settings feel more lifelike in a way that the visuals occasionally failed to do. IGN ' s Dornbush similarly felt that the sounds added realism, and praised Santaolalla's ""moving"" score. McNamara of Game Informer found that the music added tension. Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer wrote that the ""haunting and subtle melodies blend into the world seamlessly"". Eurogamer ' s Welsh praised the score for its combination of banjo and electronics . The Last of Us Part II Remastered received ""universal acclaim"" according to Metacritic, and 90% of critics recommended the game according to OpenCritic. Video Games Chronicle ' s Jordan Middler called it ""the best way to play one of the best games ever made"", and Siliconera ' s Cory Dinkel wrote ""it elevates an already near-perfect experience"". Push Square ' s Aaron Bayne found it perfectly partnered the first game's remake, Part I . Digital Trends ' s Giovanni Colantonio compared it to a Criterion Collection re-release and The Guardian ' s Keith Stuart compared replaying the game to ""rereading a favourite novel"". Critics gave the Windows version ""generally favorable"" reviews, praising the optimization though noting occasional performance issues. Destructoid ' s Smangaliso Simelane wrote that few console games look as ""beautifully detailed and borderline photorealistic"" as Remastered ; Siliconera ' s Dinkel compared the cinematography to the work of Roger Deakins and felt the improved character animations enhanced the story, and Variety ' s Katcy Stephan praised the visual and performance improvements for strengthening the narrative immersion. Some reviewers found the visual changes negligible but unnecessary due to the original's quality. The use of the DualSense's haptic technology was considered by Video Games Chronicle ' s Middler the best since Astro's Playroom (2020) and by Siliconera ' s Dinkel the best of any game to date, while Inverse ' s Kazuma Hashimoto found it strenuous after extended use. GamingBolt ' s Shubhankar Parijat considered No Return Remastered ' s standout feature. Several reviewers found the mode addictive and felt it added value and replayability, demonstrating the quality of the game's combat elements; Push Square ' s Bayne lauded its pacing and length. Some found the mode incongruous with the narrative's themes discouraging violence and felt it lacked the thematic and narrative justification of God of War Ragnarök ' s roguelike mode, while others found its gameplay repetitive and upgrades inconsequential. No Return's gameplay elements drew comparisons to the canceled multiplayer game The Last of Us Online . The scrapped levels and audio commentary were praised for providing insight into the development process, named by some as Remastered ' s standout feature; Push Square ' s Bayne hoped other developers would imitate it. Several reviewers lauded the US$10 price point for existing owners. The Last of Us Part II was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, resulting in a user review score of 3.4/10 at its nadir. Reporters noticed the review bombing occurred shortly after the game launched—too early for users to feasibly have finished it; some suggested that the reviews were based on the incomplete plot leaks. Many negative reviews criticized the characterization and plot; some complained of "" social justice warrior "" politics, with vitriolic responses to LGBT characters. CNET ' s Daniel Van Boom wrote that the review bombers did not represent the majority of players, while Kotaku ' s MacLeod identified thousands of positive reviews and felt Metacritic's system, which emphasizes scores over critique, comprised only ""a bunch of meaningless numbers and a lot of rage"". The incident led Metacritic to implement a 36-hour waiting period after release before allowing user reviews. Some players criticized Joel's death in the opening hours, perceiving a discrepancy between his cautious nature in the first game and his more trustful and protective attitude in Part II . Den of Geek ' s Matthew Byrd wrote that Joel had protected young women in the past, so his trusting of Abby in Part II was not ""entirely unreasonable"". Sam Clench of News.com.au also argued that Joel's time in Jackson had realistically made him less cynical over the years. A number of players considered Joel's brutal and undignified death ""disrespectful""; Clench rebutted that it was realistic, as most real deaths occur at unfortunate times, and described the scene as ""extremely strong, purposeful writing"". Josh Hawkins of Shacknews wrote that Joel's death was a fitting retribution for his brutal actions and murders in the previous game. Some players felt the marketing, which had altered and replaced characters in trailers to conceal Joel's death and Abby's role, constituted false advertising ; Druckmann responded that Naughty Dog had intended to preserve the game experience, ""not to bamboozle anyone or get their $60"". A subset of players criticized Abby and disapproved of her playable chapters as they had expected to control Ellie for the majority of the game. Collider ' s Dave Trumbore felt Abby's killing of Joel led to her being unfairly maligned by audiences who had failed to understand the story's message. Some players criticized Abby's muscular physique, and theories spread online that she was transgender; The Independent ' s Amy Coles and Polygon ' s Patricia Hernandez argued that this perception was a result of the lack of body diversity in games, and that the story showed Abby had the resources to achieve her physique. Coles observed that these arguments were propagated by ""a loud and determinedly misogynistic subset"" of players. Laura Bailey, who played Abby, became the target of online death threats in response to the character; Naughty Dog released a statement condemning the threats, and Bailey was supported by James Gunn , Ashley Johnson, and Craig Mazin , among others. Some members of the transgender community objected to the representation of Lev, a transgender supporting character. Criticism focused on villains using Lev's deadname , that the character was created by cisgender writers, and the use of trans stories as tragedies. Stacey Henley of VG247 responded that Lev's deadname is used sparingly and that Ian Alexander, a transgender actor, provides the character's voice and motion capture. Writing for Paste , Waverly praised the choice to have Lev played by a transgender actor, but felt there was too much emphasis on his gender identity and the suffering he experienced for it. Waverly felt that ""Lev's story isn't made for trans people, but to give cisgender players a space to connect with their guilt and pity for trans people"". Henley wrote that, while Lev's story is imperfect, it is ""a major step for trans characters in gaming, [and] focuses on a highly charismatic and central character who is far more than this transness"". Kotaku ' s MacLeod saw Lev's character as simply a way of acknowledging that trans people exist in the game's universe and wrote that it was up to the player to create their own meaning from the character. Alexander acknowledged the writers ""might have missed the mark a little bit"" regarding the use of Lev's deadname but felt Abby's response reflected the importance of allowing trans individuals the agency to discuss their gender on their own terms. A year after the game's release, Collider ' s Trumbore identified a subset of players that continued to criticize the game and its legacy, comparing it to some audience complaints about Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), though recognized it was ""quieter"" than at launch. In Games and Culture , Robert Letizi and Callan Norman described a community of users on the subreddit r/TheLastOfUs2 who continued posting hateful and discriminatory content denouncing the game several years after release as ""alt-fans"". Letizi and Norman linked the reception to the game to alt-right politics and various hate movements and conspiracy theories; they argued the response to Part II was not an outlier but an exemplar of common politically motivated responses to inclusivity in games. In July 2021, a user of the subreddit claimed they received death threats from fans of YouTube channel Girlfriend Reviews, who had posted positive videos about the game; following targeted harassment from the subreddit, Girlfriend Reviews discovered the threats were fabricated by the user. Polygon ' s Hernandez observed that the discourse surrounding The Last of Us Part II had become adversarial, with ""bigots"" attacking the game for its diverse cast and Naughty Dog becoming defensive. Vice ' s Zacny claimed that, in response to his critical review, Sony contacted him on behalf of Naughty Dog to discuss his criticisms, which they disagreed with; Zacny said the discussion, while cordial, was unusual from a large publisher. On Twitter , Druckmann expressed disapproval after journalist Jason Schreier mocked a reviewer's comparison of Part II to Schindler's List (1993); Schreier felt his reporting on Naughty Dog's crunch conditions prompted Druckmann's disapproval. A different tweet from Schreier stated that ""video games are too long"", which he later clarified was criticizing longer games being made for marketing purposes; Baker responded to the original tweet with a quote from US president Theodore Roosevelt about critics being less valuable than creators , which Schreier felt was an overreaction. Hernandez concluded that critics fearing backlash from publishers and fans was ""not an environment that is conducive to encouraging honest reviews or critical discussion, which is ultimately a disservice to the game itself"". USgamer ' s Bailey wrote that the strict review embargo prevented meaningful discussion of the narrative. Druckmann acknowledged the leaks prompted the embargo as he had felt reviews discussing plot details would have become more harmful and widespread than the leaks. The Last of Us Part II won 326 Game of the Year awards , according to tracking websites, which several outlets reported broke the record set by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015); it was later surpassed by Elden Ring (2022). The game was awarded from outlets and shows such as Den of Geek , Digital Trends , Electronic Gaming Monthly , Empire , Entertainment Weekly , Game Informer , PlayStation Blog , Push Square , and the Titanium Awards . It was named runner-up by several other publications. At the 38th Golden Joystick Awards in November 2020, it won all six awards for which it was nominated: Ultimate Game of the Year , Best Audio, Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, PlayStation Game of the Year, and Studio of the Year for Naughty Dog. It led the nominees for the Game Awards 2020 with eleven nominations, of which it won seven, the most in the show's history to date: Game of the Year , Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Audio Design, Innovation in Accessibility, Best Action/Adventure, and Best Performance (for Bailey). The Last of Us Part II was nominated for twenty-four awards at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, the most in the show's history; it won eight, including Outstanding Direction in a Game Cinema, Franchise Adventure Game, Lead Performance in a Drama (for Johnson and Bailey), and Supporting Performance in a Drama (for Baker). It was nominated for thirteen awards at the 17th British Academy Games Awards , the most in the show's history, winning for Animation, the publicly voted EE Game of the Year, and Performer in a Leading Role (for Bailey). It led the nominees at the 24th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards with eleven nominations, of which it won two: Outstanding Achievement in Animation and Outstanding Achievement in Story . It also led the 19th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards with fifteen nominations and eight wins, and the 21st Game Developers Choice Awards with six nominations, of which it won one. It received the most nominations at the inaugural Global Industry Game Awards with thirteen, of which it won three: 3D Animation, Cinematography, and Story. In its release weekend, The Last of Us Part II sold over four million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, beating Marvel's Spider-Man ' s 3.3 million and God of War ' s 3.1 million in the same period. It had the biggest launch of 2020 for both physical and digital sales. On the PlayStation Store, it was the most-downloaded PlayStation 4 game in North America and Europe in June; in July, it was fifth in North America and tenth in Europe; in November, it was the eighth in North America and seventh in Europe; and overall for 2020, it ranked sixth in North America and eighth in Europe. In the United States, it was the best-selling game of June 2020 and became the third-best-selling game of the year within two weeks, generating the highest first-month sales of the year. By August 2020, it had become the third-highest-grossing PlayStation game in the United States, behind Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War . Overall, it was the sixth-best-selling game of the year in the United States; it was the third-best-selling for PlayStation consoles, and the best-selling PlayStation 4-only game. By June 2022, the game had sold over ten million copies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, The Last of Us Part II became the fastest-selling physical PlayStation 4 game, outselling previous record holder Uncharted 4 by at least one percent and The Last of Us by 76 percent; it was the nation's eighth-best-selling game of the year with 543,218 copies sold, and the seventh for physical sales. A price discount in February 2021 saw it re-enter the UK physical charts in third place, representing a 3,992 percent increase. In Japan, The Last of Us Part II was the best-selling game during its first week, selling an estimated 178,696 physical copies. In Germany, it sold over 200,000 copies in June 2020 and 500,000 by December 2020. In Australia, it was the eighth-best-selling of the year, and the third for physical sales. Remastered debuted at third on the physical sales chart in the United Kingdom for the first week and second for January, beating Part I ' s launch by more than 150%. Critics concurred that The Last of Us Part II was among the best games of the eighth generation of video game consoles and a great closing title before the ninth . An internal review by Sony's competitor Microsoft —published as a court document in the Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit in 2021—said the game ""sets a new bar for what we should hope to be able to achieve going into a new generation of consoles"". Many outlets considered it among the greatest video games ever made, and several called it one of the best-written. The Last of Us Part II is expected to be adapted into multiple seasons of the television adaptation of The Last of Us , starting with the second season , which premiered in April 2025. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin wanted to avoid filler between the seasons, starting Part II ' s narrative immediately. The second season covers the story in Jackson and Ellie's three days in Seattle, while the third is expected to shift perspective to Abby; Mazin suspected the story may require a fourth. Kaitlyn Dever portrays Abby in the series, alongside Young Mazino as Jesse and Isabela Merced as Dina, and Jeffrey Wright reprises his role as Isaac from the game. Druckmann and Gross wrote an outline for a story set after Part II by April 2021, but noted it was not in active development. Druckmann later clarified the outline was for a ""small story"" focused on Tommy, rather than a full sequel to Part II ; he felt it would eventually be released, possibly as a game or television series. In 2023, Druckmann confirmed he had a concept for a third main game in the series that is thematically consistent with the first two games, stating there is ""probably one more chapter to this story"". In March 2025, Druckmann warned not to ""bet on there being more of Last of Us "", noting the television series ""could be it"".",Naughty Dog [ a ],"PlayStation 4 June 19, 2020 PlayStation 5 January 19, 2024 Windows April 3, 2025",PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Windows,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,her son; labor; mother; pregnant,father,post-traumatic; trauma,body; infected; mutated,escape; locked,kill; killed; murder; rape; torture; tortured; violence; violent,rape,creature; witch,girl; teen; young,lgbtq
The Medium,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_(video_game)," The Medium is a psychological horror video game developed and published by Bloober Team . It was released for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on January 28, 2021, for PlayStation 5 on September 3, 2021, for Amazon Luna on February 17, 2022, and for macOS on August 31, 2023. A Nintendo Switch version was released on July 29, 2023. The Medium is a psychological horror game played in third-person as Marianne, a medium who can travel into the spirit realm. Being able to inhabit both worlds aids puzzle solving. Her psychic abilities may also be used against hostile forces and are recharged by interacting with energy spots called spirit wells. The Medium is set in post-Communism Poland in 1999. Marianne, a spirit medium that helps troubled souls seek final respite, has a recurring dream of a man shooting a young girl by a lake. While grieving over the death of her foster father, Marianne receives a mysterious phone call from a man named Thomas, who knows of her abilities. Thomas offers to explain the origin of Marianne's powers, as well as the meaning of the dream. However, he is only willing to talk if Marianne agrees to meet him at the Niwa Workers' Resort, an abandoned communist-era vacation resort in the Polish wilderness. The Resort had been shuttered by the government years earlier after an event called the Niwa Massacre, in which a large number of people were murdered and the survivors fled the area. While exploring Niwa, Marianne finds the place has strong ties to the spirit realm, and evidence that Thomas, the resort's manager, and his daughter Lilianne were at the epicentre of the Niwa Massacre. In the spirit world, she encounters Sadness, the spirit of a young girl who warns her of the Maw, a hostile and malevolent spirit that has managed to also partially exist in the real world. The Maw was responsible for the Niwa Massacre by occupying human hosts and using their bodies to murder others, and begins hunting down Marianne to sate its hunger and escape Niwa. Marianne repeatedly offers to send Sadness to her peace, but she refuses. Through her visions, Marianne finds out that Sadness is the spirit of Lilianne, who was molested by Thomas' older and trusted friend Richard. Marianne pieces together enough clues to learn that Thomas was also a medium, and due to this was experimented on by Nazis and Soviets, who found out that his powers could be used to sever people's minds from their bodies. Eventually Thomas fled back to Poland, hiding at Niwa and starting a family, but an agent of Służba Bezpieczeństwa named Henry discovered him. Henry subdued Thomas and forced him to watch as he set fire to Thomas' home with his children inside, causing Thomas to attack and murder him. Marianne comes to realize that she is Thomas' youngest daughter, having fallen into a coma after the fire, and that Thomas left her at the hospital while he remained with Lilianne at Niwa. Marianne discovers a fallout bunker hidden beneath the ruins of her family home where she encounters Thomas' spirit half. He explains to Marianne that Lilianne had trouble controlling her own powers, so Thomas kept her confined in the bunker. However, this did not stop Lilianne's powers from going out of control, and after she was raped by Richard, she created the Maw as the manifestation of her tormented soul. Eventually the Maw broke out of the bunker and caused the Niwa Massacre. While Thomas' spirit half is confident that Thomas would never hurt Lilianne, he is unaware of Thomas' current whereabouts. As the Maw approaches, Thomas' spirit half assures Marianne that she is the only one that can end this, and sends her off, preparing to sacrifice himself to delay the Maw. Still troubled over Lilianne's fate, Marianne leaves the bunker and heads for the lake that she saw in her dreams. There, she encounters Lilianne, who explains that the dream Marianne has been seeing is not a memory of the past, but a vision of the future. She then hands Marianne a gun and pleads with her to kill her, as the Maw cannot be banished as long as she is alive; explaining why Sadness, her spirit, refused to be sent off to peace. Marianne hesitates, and, considering Thomas' words, threatens to kill herself instead, as without her as a medium, the Maw will remain trapped in Niwa forever. The Maw then arrives, forcing Marianne to fire, but it is left unclear as to whom she shoots. In a post-credits scene, a man is seen wandering the spirit world, stopping briefly to pick up Thomas' pocketwatch. The Medium was developed by Bloober Team , with lead designer Wojciech Piejko and producer Jacek Zieba coming up with the idea in 2012. The core concepts of the game had been about a medium and her abilities to see two worlds simultaneously. Piejko said The Medium imparts the message that ""there is no universal truth"". They had originally planned for release on the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and Wii U in 2012, but rendering two point-of-views at the same time was a technical challenge for these platforms, and Bloober Team shelved the idea. In the following years, the concept of The Medium became its own type of mythos within Bloober as the company waited for technology to catch up. After Microsoft provided developers with preliminary material on the upcoming capabilities of the Xbox Series X/S consoles (which were released in November 2020), Bloober Team recognized they could now build out The Medium and began development. Initially they approached the game with a first-person perspective , splitting the player's screen in two. After deciding to have Marianne exist in both the real and spirit world as to handle the situation with collisions, they found initial playtesters had difficulty maneuvering in this view, often twice going over an area to first focus on one world's view and then to focus on the other. They took cues from Japanese horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil which used fixed cameras and third-person perspective to better present the game for players to see both worlds at the same time while capturing the spirit of these horror games. This also helped to enhance the player's immersion in the game. They maintained this split-screen concept in cutscenes as well, though frequently switching up camera angles. This partially was used to mask unrendered details in some settings, but was also used to keep a sense of unease as when Marianne has a conversation with characters in the spirit world, while her real self is shown interacting with nothing. They had chosen Poland during the 1990s, following its transition from a communistic to a democratic government in 1989, as the game's setting, as the nation's history represented the nature of duality, an overarching theme of the game. Aware that the post-war era as well as the more recent democratic era were not well known to an international audience, part of Bloober Team's goal was to make the setting approachable to the wide audience, and covered both aspects of these parts of Poland's history within the game. They recognized that with the success of their prior game Observer as well as interest in television shows about the Eastern Bloc such as Chernobyl and Dark , the Polish setting would be of interest to players. The Soviet-era Hotel Niwa is based on a one-to-one rendition of the existing Hotel Cracovia located in Kraków . The opening apartments at the start of the game, while based on a real building in Kraków, is an Easter egg to Observer: System Redux , where the same building is also present in that game's future setting. They modelled the supernatural setting after Zdzisław Beksiński 's dystopian surrealist artwork. Audio for the game was made by a "" Silent Hill dream team"" according to Bloober Team, including Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka , singer Mary Elizabeth McGlynn , and voice actor Troy Baker ; Yamaoka was persuaded to take on the music when Piejko gave him a gameplay demonstration. Yamaoka and composer Arkadiusz Reikowski were tasked with scoring the physical and spiritual plane, respectively. Using synthesiser and analogue sounds, Reikowski likened his approach to that of Stranger Things and Chernobyl . Baker voices the primary antagonist, known as the Maw, for whom another actor performed the motion capture on stilts. Actor Kelly Burke provided the voice for protagonist Marianne, with Weronika Rosati and Marcin Dorociński providing design and motion capture for Marianne and Thomas within the game. The developers had planned out the camera and actor's direction for motion capture prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , which made it easy to complete the motion capture sessions under COVID-19 regulations during 2020. Overall, the game has about 90 minutes of motion capture. While the game takes place in Poland, Bloober Team specifically chose to have the characters speak with American accents as to make the game approachable. The team had planned to include the option to switch dialog to Polish voice-overs with English subtitles but the pandemic caused them to fall back on this plan. Following its initial 2012 announcement and subsequent drawback, The Medium was reannounced in May 2020 to be released for Windows and Xbox Series X/S . Originally scheduled for 10 December 2020, the release was eventually delayed to January 28, 2021, due to the pandemic. A PlayStation 5 version was released on September 3, 2021, with a version for Amazon Luna releasing on February 17, 2022. A Nintendo Switch cloud version released on July 29, 2023. A planned summer release for macOS and Apple Silicon was announced on February 16, 2023. The Medium received ""generally favorable"" or ""mixed or average"" reviews, depending on the platform, according to review aggregator Metacritic . IGN awarded the game an 8/10, stating ""Brilliantly paced and palpably tense, The Medium is a psychological horror adventure that's all thriller and no filler."" Bloober Team reported that within a few days of launch, they had been able to turn a profit from the development of The Medium from its initial sales. The game was nominated for best action adventure and best indie game at Gamescom 2020. Gary Dauberman announced in July 2025 that he and Mia Maniscalco will produce a film adaptation of The Medium via his Coin Operated label.",Bloober Team,"Windows, Xbox Series X/S January 28, 2021 PlayStation 5 September 3, 2021 Amazon Luna February 17, 2022 Nintendo Switch June 29, 2023 macOS August 31, 2023",Windows Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 5 macOS Nintendo Switch,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,daughter,family; father,,soul,escape,kill; murder; murdered; rape; raped,forced; rape; raped,evil; witch,girl; young; young girl,
The Mortuary Assistant,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mortuary_Assistant," The Mortuary Assistant is a 2022 horror game developed by DarkStone Digital and published by DreadXP . Set in 1998 in a small town in Connecticut, players control a newly hired assistant at a haunted mortuary . Players control Rebecca Owens, an assistant at a mortuary who embalms corpses under the watch of her boss, Raymond Delver. Players must engage in the mundane aspects of this job while avoiding demonic possession in the haunted mortuary. This involves jump scares and puzzles. PC Gamer described it as ""more or less a walking simulator with some haunted scenery"". It is played from a first-person perspective. Players must correctly identify which corpses are possessed, the demon possessing them, and perform the correct exorcism to survive. This process is timed, as indicated by a set of Post-It notes to show the progress of the demon possessing Rebecca. It has multiple endings, and a new ending was added in July 2023. The story is procedurally generated , but the game remembers which vignettes the player has seen and shows different ones in each playthrough. In 1998, Rebecca Owens (played by Melissa Medina) arrives at the River Fields mortuary in Connecticut to begin her new role as an assistant to her former teacher and the mortuary's owner, Raymond Delver (portrayed by Adam Bennett). During her orientation, Rebecca encounters some unsettling occurrences, prompting Raymond to send her home early. Later that night, Raymond calls her back for an urgent night shift. Upon her arrival, he locks her inside the mortuary, revealing that a demon is trying to possess her. To prevent this, she must locate the possessed cadaver, perform a ritual to bind the demon to it, and then incinerate it, all while carrying out her regular embalming duties. Rebecca faces interference from the demon, which uses hallucinations and sensory manipulation to hinder her work. If she survives the night, Raymond explains that, having been targeted by the demon, it will haunt her for life unless she continues to work at the mortuary to keep it at bay. After Rebecca endures a second night, Raymond confesses that he too was once a target and has been haunted by demons, which is why he is seeking a permanent solution to banish them. On subsequent nights, Rebecca can eventually learn that Raymond keeps a possessed woman, Valery, locked in the mortuary basement and collects her blood to produce the Reagent needed to carry out the binding rituals. Despite reservations, Rebecca continues working in the mortuary and the demon begins taunting her by forcing her to relive memories of her past, where her mother died of a drug overdose and she subsequently became a drug addict nearly dying of an overdose herself, resulting in her father's death when he tried to save her. Realizing the demon is trying to use her guilt over her father's death against her, Rebecca can finally come to terms with his death and briefly witnesses a vision of her father who assures her she is not at fault for his death. The game's final ending is triggered when Rebecca attempts to banish the demon possessing Valery. However, the ritual fails and Valery attacks Rebecca. Raymond intervenes and his shirt is torn open to reveal a mysterious sigil drawn on his chest, which destroys Valery and part of the sigil is burned away. Rebecca accuses Raymond of hiding more secrets from her and she angrily storms out of the basement. After Rebecca leaves, Raymond enters a hidden chamber where his possessed mother is chained up. He cuts off a piece of his mother's flesh and uses it to restore the sigil. All the while, the demon taunts Raymond by pointing out his source of Reagent is gone, but Raymond remains committed to fighting the demons. Brian Clarke developed The Mortuary Assistant himself, based in Connecticut . He had previously worked on massively multiplayer online role-playing games . Clarke's influences included creepy online videos and found footage films, especially Paranormal Activity .  A prototype was released in 2020, and Clarke was surprised to find that many people wanted a full simulation of embalming. After researching embalming, he mostly implemented it realistically. Some aspects were streamlined for time, and he used archaic procedures when he thought they made scenes creepier. DreadXP released it on Windows on August 2, 2022, and on Switch on April 20, 2023. The game was released for PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , and Xbox Series X/S on August 2, 2024, alongside an update containing improvements and added features to the base game. A film adaptation was announced in September 2022. DreadXP said it will focus on ""the overall narrative"" rather than replicating specific gameplay elements or endings. On Metacritic , The Mortuary Assistant received mixed reviews for Windows and positive reviews for PlayStation 5. On release, it became a bestseller on Steam . Despite saying that it is short and ""a little rough"", Joel Franey of GamesRadar+ said its atmosphere makes up for these shortcomings, and it would later be included in list of top horror games by GamesRadar+ . Cass Marshall, writing for Polygon , called it ""a little clunky"" and said the puzzles can be confusing, but still ""delivers a fun set of scares"" while being a satisfying simulation. Andrew Heaton of Rely on Horror praised the game for its unique setting, tapping into the fear of death , but found the gameplay somewhat repetitive and encountered some technical issues. Similarly, Harrison Abott of Bloody Disgusting praised the game's content but claimed to encounter many technical issues. Reviewing the PlayStation 5 version, Jordan Biordi of CG Magazine called the gameplay loop ""incredibly effective"", but complained that the gamepad controls were subpar, concluding that the PS5 version was ""vastly inferior"" to the PC version. Similarly, Timothy Nunes of Playstation Universe wrote in his review that, despite the interesting concept, he wished that he ""had just played it on PC"" due to its poor controls. On September 22, 2022, DreadXP and its parent company Epic Pictures Group announced the development of a movie adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant with Jeremiah Kipp writing and directing, and Willa Holland starring as Rebecca Owens and Paul Sparks as Raymond Delver. On July 25, 2025, Shudder revealed at their Comic-Con panel that they have acquired the film, and will release it in 2026.",DarkStone Digital,"Windows August 2, 2022 Switch April 20, 2023 PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S August 2, 2024",Windows Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbox One Xbox Series X/S,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,mother,father,hallucination,flesh; memories,chained; locked,,,witch,,
The Path,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Path_(video_game),"The Path is a psychological horror art game developed by Tale of Tales originally released for the Microsoft Windows operating system on March 18, 2009, in English and Dutch , and later ported to Mac OS X by TransGaming Technologies . It is inspired by several versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood , and by folklore tropes and conventions in general, but set in contemporary times. The player can choose to control one of six different sisters, who are sent one-by-one on errands by their mother to see their sick grandmother. The player can choose whether to stay on the path or to wander, where wolves are lying in wait. According to the developer, the game is not meant to be played in the traditional sense, in that there is no winning strategy. In fact, much of the gameplay requires the player to choose the losing path for the sisters to run into encounters which they (and the player) are meant to experience. Even the story narratives are not typical for a game, as explained by the developer, ""We are not story-tellers in the traditional sense of the word. In the sense that we know a story and we want to share it with you. Our work is more about exploring the narrative potential of a situation. We create only the situation. And the actual story emerges from playing, partially in the game, partially in the player’s mind."" The game begins in an apartment. The player is shown six sisters to choose from and is given no information about them other than a name. When the player selects a girl, the journey begins. The player is given control of the girl, and is instructed: ""Go to Grandmother's house and stay on the path."" As the player explores, they find various items scattered around. For a girl to pick up or examine an object, the player needs to either click on the interaction button or move her close enough for a superimposed image of the object to appear on the screen, then let go of the controls. The character will interact and an image will appear on the screen, indicating what has been unlocked; every item a girl encounters in the forest shows in some shape or form in Grandmother's house, and some objects open up whole new rooms. Small text will also appear, a thought from the current character. Some items can only be picked up once and do not appear in subsequent runs. However, each character will say something different about an object, so the player has the option to access a ""basket"" to see what they have collected. The Wolf is the antagonist in the game and takes on a different form for each girl.  The forms represent tribulations that are associated with the stages of childhood and adolescence.  It is not required to find the Wolf. In this game, there are no requirements but the ending at Grandmother's house does change dramatically after the wolf encounter. The girl encounters the Wolf, there is a brief cut scene , and the screen goes black. Afterward, the girl is lying on the path in front of Grandmother's house. When the player enters Grandmother's house, the style of gameplay changes. It is now in first person, and the character moves forward along a pre-determined path. If the player got there without interacting with the Wolf, they arrive safely, cozy up next to Grandmother and are sent back to the apartment. The girl the player guided will still be there, and can be played again. If the player did go to the Wolf, then everything in the house is darker, and if the player remains still for too long, darkness clouds the screen, and something growls. Depending on the girl, doors are scratched, or furniture tipped over and broken, or strange black threads are draped across everything. Instead of ending with Grandmother, the music crescendos as the player enters a final surreal room before falling down, and things black out again. Images flash on the screen, featuring the girl being attacked by her Wolf, before the player is relocated back in the apartment. The girl played is not there, and will remain absent. When all of the girls have encountered their wolves, a girl in a white dress, who could be previously encountered by the sisters, becomes playable and visits Grandmother's house. The girl will then travel through the house, now a combination of all of the end rooms of the previous girls ending with the no-wolf room. Upon reaching the grandmother, the girl appears in the apartment covered in blood, but alive. The sisters all return through the door and the game starts over. The Path was announced on the Tale of Tales Game Design forum on March 16, 2006, under the working title 144 , on the pattern of their first-started, on-hiatus Tale of Tales 8 (chosen for the universal, language-independent nature of Arabic numerals ). This number originally referred to the six 24-hour periods of the six days in which the game was set, but in the released version refers to the 144 coin flowers. The Path was released on March 19, 2009. It became available for Mac on May 7, 2009. Iain McCafferty of VideoGamer.com called The Path ""a hugely significant work in terms of what a video game can be beyond the realms of throwaway entertainment"" and ""potentially a seminal moment in video games."" He claimed that ""It will be years before a game made by the big budget software houses like Ubisoft or EA is brave enough to attempt anything remotely similar, but The Path shows promising signs that gaming is starting to grow up."" Heather Chaplin of Filmmaker Magazine pointed out how uniquely feminine The Path is: ""For me, The Path is about what a remarkably fine line it is that separates childhood from adulthood, innocence from cynicism, and how utterly not black-and-white most things in life are."" Tim Martin of The Daily Telegraph cited The Path as a recent example of a ""vigorous experimentation with techniques of narrative."" He likened it to ""an Angela Carter novel, as siphoned through The Sims ."" Justin McElroy of Engadget commented on gameplay mechanics: ""You get one instruction in the game and you have to disregard it. That's the kind of experience we're talking about here. Once you leave the path you'll find innumerable creepy yet beautifully rendered experiences to take part in, but you're never really given any guidance as what the point or object of all of it is. Basically, it's gameplay in the abstract."" Mike Gust of Tap Repeatedly called The Path ""a sort of anti-game"", ""a game turned inside out in service to something deeply personal, human and disturbing"". John Walker of RockPaperShotGun remarked ""I kind of don’t like the game"" but noted that this ""is not a criticism. If anything, it’s the highest compliment I could pay it. While there’s spooky woods, abandoned playgrounds, creepy dolls, and many other familiar themes of horror, these offer no scares. For me, the horror comes from what appears to be the most abhorrently pessimistic presentation of adolescence."" Steven Poole of Edge opined that the game is ""a supremely boring collection of FMVs with pretensions to interactivity that very quickly wears out its joke about control and becomes a tedious slab of nihilistic whimsy,"" yet noting that the game features a ""lugubrious, Lynchian surrealism"" and that ""in its ornery and precious way, The Path is a triumph of atmosphere, coming much closer than the cruder shocks of games such as Silent Hill or BioShock to a dramatization of what Ernst Jentsch and Freud analyzed as the ""uncanny"" in literature."" An in-progress, alpha-stage version of The Path was nominated for Excellence in Visual Arts after being exhibited at the Independent Games Festival in 2008. The game also has been honored with two awards at Bilbao, Spain's hóPLAY International Video Game Festival. The game won Best Sound and Best Design.",Tale of Tales,"March 18, 2009 May 7, 2009 (Mac OS X) [ 1 ] Autumn 2009 (Polish) December 11, 2009 (Russian) [ 2 ] July 7, 2010 (Japanese) [ 3 ]",Microsoft Windows Mac OS X [ 1 ],True,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,mother,,,experimentation,locked,rape; raped,rape; raped,,girl,
The Tartarus Key,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tartarus_Key,"The Tartarus Key is an adventure video game developed by Vertical Reach and published by Armor Games Studios in 2023.  It features escape the room gameplay. Protagonist Alex Young wakes in a strange mansion.  She must solve puzzles in each room before she can exit.  Some of these puzzles involve other prisoners, and the ending that players receive depends on how many people they save.  It is played from a first-person perspective and uses PlayStation 1 -era graphics. The puzzles are not timed. Armor Games Studios released The Tartarus Key for Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on May 31, 2023. The Tartarus Key received mixed reviews on Metacritic. Describing it as ""a must play for puzzle fans"", Rock Paper Shotgun said the attention to detail necessary to solve the puzzles makes it ""almost an immersive sim "" and that some of them ""feel revelatory to solve"". Although they said puzzle game fans might enjoy it, Eurogamer felt that the game's meta aspects prevented it from becoming scary, making it more like a real-life escape room parlor game; Rock Paper Shotgun instead praised these meta elements.  Though acknowledging that The Tartarus Key is not scary, Rock Paper Shotgun felt it effectively evokes nostalgia for a range of horror franchises. Slant Magazine , who did not like the narrative elements, said The Tartarus Key ""squeaks by on the strength of its puzzles alone"". Push Square praised the retro graphics, writing, and puzzles, though they said some puzzles feel ""too obtuse"".",Vertical Reach,"WW : May 31, 2023",Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 Windows Xbox One Xbox Series X/S,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,,,,,escape; prison,,,witch,young,

The Walking Dead,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28video_game%29," The Walking Dead is a 2012 episodic graphic adventure video game developed and published by Telltale Games . Set in the same universe as the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman , it is the first installment in Telltale's The Walking Dead video game series . The game follows Lee Everett , a convicted criminal who becomes the guardian of a young girl named Clementine amidst the onset of a zombie apocalypse in Georgia . Player decisions, such as dialogue choices and actions, influence the story's direction, with the consequences of these choices carrying over across the game's episodes. Telltale developed The Walking Dead after securing a deal with Robert Kirkman and Warner Bros. in 2011. Influenced by narrative-driven games like Heavy Rain and Mass Effect , it focused on player choice and character-driven storytelling rather than action. Kirkman provided oversight while allowing Telltale creative freedom, ensuring the game aligned with the comics. The choice system influenced character interactions and minor events but did not significantly alter the overall story. Developed for multiple platforms, the game faced technical challenges with save data and release scheduling. Released in five episodes between April and November 2012 on various platforms, The Walking Dead received widespread praise for its emotional depth, the dynamic between Lee and Clementine, and its impact on the adventure game genre. It won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications , and has been regarded as one of the greatest video games ever made . By the end of 2012, it had sold over 8.5 million episodes, with total sales reaching 28 million copies by July 2014, making it the best-selling adventure game of all time . In 2013, Telltale expanded the game into a franchise by releasing an additional downloadable episode, 400 Days , to extend the first season and bridge the gap towards Season 2 , which was released in 2013 and 2014. Season 3 and the final season were released in 2016–2017 and 2018–2019, respectively, along with a spin-off game based on the character Michonne . The Walking Dead is a point-and-click graphic adventure video game played from a third-person perspective . In the game, the player character , Lee Everett, tries to survive and protect a young girl named Clementine during the midst of a zombie apocalypse , working with a small group of survivors. Using an on-screen reticle , the player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of collected items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings and options to determine the nature of that interaction. The player must solve environmental puzzles or talk to different characters to progress the story. According to Robert Kirkman , The Walking Dead is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead . Some parts of the game require timed responses from the player, often leading to significant decisions that will impact the game's story, in the manner of role-playing games (RPGs). Some conversation trees require the player to make a selection within a limited time, otherwise Lee will remain quiet, which can affect how other characters respond to him. Unlike in other RPGs such as the Mass Effect or Fallout series, where choices fall on either side of a ""good or evil"" scale, the choices within The Walking Dead have ambiguous results, having an effect on the attitude of the non-player characters towards Lee. The player can choose to play in ""Minimal"" mode, disabling hints and the ""choice notification"" feature that signals changes in the game or characters' attitudes toward Lee. In more action-based sequences, the player must follow on-screen prompts for quick time events (QTEs) so as to keep themselves or other characters alive; if they die, the game restarts from just prior to the QTE. Each episode of the game includes several points where the player must choose between two options. The player can create multiple saves and use a ""rewind"" feature to revisit and change previous decisions, allowing them to explore different outcomes. This is a broad overview of the plot. Certain decisions made by the player will alter details of specific events. The Walking Dead occurs simultaneously with the events from the original comic series, where a zombie apocalypse overwhelms much of society. On day one of the outbreak, convicted criminal Lee Everett (voiced by Dave Fennoy ) is being transported to prison when the police car crashes after hitting a walker. After killing the reanimated cop, Lee flees from a group of walkers and takes shelter in a suburban home, where he meets Clementine ( Melissa Hutchison ), a young girl whose parents had traveled to Savannah. They are rescued by Shawn Greene (Peter Edward Mussad), who takes them to his father Hershel 's (Chuck Kourouklis) farm, where they meet Kenny (Gavin Hammon), his wife Katjaa ( Cissy Jones ), and their son Duck (Max Kaufman). After Shawn is killed by walkers, Hershel forces the group to leave. They travel to Macon, Lee's hometown, and join another group led by Lilly ( Nicki Rapp ), barricaded in Lee's family pharmacy. The group includes Glenn (Nick Herman), who eventually leaves to find friends in Atlanta. Three months later, the group has holed up in a nearby motel and is low on supplies. They encounter a group of survivors, including Ben Paul (Trevor Hoffmann), whose teacher's death shows the group that everyone is already infected, turning into walkers upon death, regardless of being bitten. They make a deal with the St. Johns, a family running a nearby dairy farm, to exchange gasoline for food. However, they discover the St. Johns partake in cannibalism. The group loses two of their own, including Lilly's father Larry ( Terry McGovern ), but eventually escapes the farm, leaving it overrun by walkers. On their way back to the motel, they find an abandoned car full of supplies and take what they need. Later, bandits attack the motel, drawing a horde of walkers. The group escapes, but Duck is bitten. Lilly, hostile after Larry's death, murders one of the group members and leaves the group. The remaining survivors head to Savannah by train, planning to find a boat to escape the mainland. Along the way, they meet Chuck ( Roger Jackson ), a homeless survivor who advises Lee to teach Clementine how to defend herself. En route to Savannah, Duck succumbs to his bite, and in turn, Katjaa commits suicide. Near Savannah, the group meets Omid (Owen Thomas) and Christa (Mara Junot), a couple who joins them. A walkie-talkie that Clementine carries suddenly activates, with a man claiming he has her parents in Savannah. In Savannah, the group sets up shelter in an abandoned mansion but loses Chuck to walkers. Lee and Kenny discover that all the boats in the area are either gone or destroyed, and that the walled community of Crawford has scavenged most of the supplies. Separated from the group, Lee encounters another group led by Vernon ( Butch Engle ), who helps him return to the mansion, where they discover a motorboat in a shed. The group raids Crawford for supplies, only to find the community overrun by walkers. They manage to escape, but not without losses. Vernon leaves, doubting Lee's ability to protect Clementine. Clementine, desperate to find her parents, goes missing. In his haste to find her, Lee is bitten by a walker. Realizing he doesn't have much time left, Lee tries to find Vernon's group but discovers they have stolen the boat. Clementine contacts Lee via walkie-talkie, telling him that she is being held at a downtown hotel, the same one where her parents had stayed. Lee's group heads to the hotel, navigating rooftops to avoid walkers in the streets. Kenny is seemingly lost after sacrificing himself to save another member. Separated from Omid and Christa, Lee reaches the hotel alone and confronts Clementine's captor, The Stranger (Anthony Lam), who reveals he is the owner of the car they had previously ransacked. After killing him, Lee and Clementine cover themselves in walker guts to avoid detection and head through the streets. They encounter Clementine's zombified parents, and a weakening Lee helps her reach an abandoned store. Inside, Lee urges Clementine to escape the city and find Omid and Christa. He instructs her to either shoot him or leave him to become a walker. In a post-credits scene , Clementine, having escaped the city, spots two figures in the distance who notice her. The downloadable content 400 Days relates stories of other survivors in the zombie apocalypse, starting at its onset and occurring concurrently with the first season. There are five stories: On Day 400, Tavia (Rashida Clendening) finds a billboard near the now-overrun truck stop, displaying photos of the survivors and a map leading to a supposed safe haven. She tracks them down and offers them sanctuary. Bonnie accepts, while the others' decisions depend on their past choices and whether Tavia can successfully convince them to join her. The game was separated into five episodes, released between April and November 2012. Each episode lasts about two and a half hours. An additional episode, titled 400 Days , was released in July 2013 as downloadable content , bridging the gap between the first and second season . It is presented in a nonlinear narrative style; players can approach the five stories in any order they choose. Before The Walking Dead , Telltale Games had success with episodic adventures based on established properties, such as Sam & Max and Tales of Monkey Island . Sean Vanaman noted that before securing The Walking Dead , Telltale's Carl Muckenhoupt was working on a text-based prototype with an ""active world,"" where objects and characters acted independently of player input. Although Telltale considered using this concept for a Left 4 Dead spinoff, discussions with Valve did not materialize. Telltale announced deals with Robert Kirkman and Warner Bros. in February 2011 for episodic series based on The Walking Dead and Fables , with The Walking Dead series set to start in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the game's development, Robert Kirkman and comic publisher Skybound Entertainment collaborated with Telltale. Kirkman, who had enjoyed Telltale's Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People , appreciated their storytelling focus and player engagement. Telltale's proposal, centered on decision-making and survival rather than action, appealed to him. Kirkman provided oversight on story elements for The Walking Dead universe while remaining hands-off in development. The CEO of Telltale, Dan Connors, noted that Kirkman's involvement helped shape the story and introduce new characters while incorporating established ones from the comics. However, Kirkman requested not to include Rick Grimes due to his long-term plans for the character. Although initially unimpressed with an early build, Kirkman praised the near-final version of the game, saying, ""Holy shit guys, you did it"". Telltale drew inspiration from various media when developing The Walking Dead . Gameplay-wise, they referenced titles like Heavy Rain and the Uncharted series for in-game cinematics , while the player-choice mechanic was influenced by the Mass Effect series. They also sought inspiration from television shows like Game of Thrones and Mad Men for developing well-rounded characters within a short timeframe. Connors also believed that traditional conversation systems often lacked a ""believable rhythm"", leading to the introduction of a timed input system for more realistic dialogue. The game's story was designed with the final scene of the fifth episode—where Clementine either shoots Lee or leaves him to become a walker—as the established ending that the game would build toward. Clementine's role was considered critical to the game's writing, with the team focusing on making her a ""moral compass"" while ensuring that as a child character, she wasn't perceived as whiny or annoying. Similarly, Lee, the game's Black protagonist, was designed to incorporate his race without making it integral to the story; instead, societal reactions shaped the character without dictating the narrative's direction. The Stranger scene in the hotel was also planned early on to evaluate the player's moral choices. According to Sean Vanaman , each episode was developed by pairing a writer with a game designer to ensure cohesive plot and gameplay. Some gameplay ideas were discarded, such as a scene with the survivor group firing at zombies, as they did not fit the desired sense of panic. A major aspect of writing The Walking Dead was the concept of choice and consequence, particularly regarding life and death for both the player and non-player characters. Telltale, founded by former LucasArts employees who had worked on games where the player could not die, incorporated player death if decisions weren't made quickly enough. Additionally, the player's choices could lead to the permanent deaths of non-player characters. This time-sensitive decision-making came from the prototype zombie game Muckenhoupt made and was designed to maintain the game's pace. This led to the idea of tracking player decisions globally, and Telltale expanded their tracking tools to accommodate for such an idea. Telltale aimed to immerse players in the story through non-game-ending choices, reducing the desire to use the rewind feature. Although choices were designed to seem significant, they often had little effect on the larger narrative. According to writer Gary Whitta , all choices were meant to be equally difficult, and the writers worked to keep the dialogue neutral to create an even split among player decisions. For example, in Episode 1, most players chose to save Carley over Doug when each is attacked by walkers, and in Episode 2, most opted to cut off the teacher's leg rather than leave him behind to the walkers. In response, Telltale adjusted dialogue in later episodes to eliminate any perceived ""right"" choice, leaving the notion up to the player themself. The writers of the game had to balance the established characters and timeline from the comic series while allowing for player choice. For instance, in the first episode, players are introduced to Shawn Greene, who is depicted as a walker in the comics. To remain consistent, the story ensures that Shawn is always bitten, though players are given the option to attempt to save him. This choice doesn't affect Shawn's fate but influences Kenny's perception of Lee. Telltale also designed characters and choices with player biases in mind. Larry, a harsh character introduced early on, was expected to be disliked by most players. In response, Telltale created a scene in the second episode where Larry's daughter, Lilly, attempts to redeem him in the player's eyes, hoping to sway the player's perception of Larry. This worked as intended, with 75% of players choosing to attempt to save Larry when he suffers a heart attack. Player decisions also shaped the narrative in future episodes. In the fourth episode, for instance, Whitta referenced player choices about Duck's death—specifically who was to kill him—from episode 3 to design a similar moral dilemma where Kenny confronts the death of another boy and players must choose whether he or Kenny should kill him, or whether they should walk away, negatively impacting other characters' view of Lee. The fifth episode's first act contained 32 possible variations, based on past player decisions, which helped make the experience feel personalized and organic to each player rather than following a predetermined path through the game. The Walking Dead ' s game engine was optimized for multi-platform release, including PCs , gaming consoles and mobile devices , to simplify porting. Despite this, the development team tailored control schemes for each platform, particularly using their experience from the Back to the Future game to refine touchscreen controls on mobile devices. One major challenge across all five episodes was the save game format, which required frequent updates and fixes across platforms, sometimes invalidating existing saves. Unique fixes on one platform would often resurface as issues on others. Connors noted that for future series, they would address save game issues more carefully, using insights gained from the first season. Telltale previously struggled to synchronize multi-platform releases, particularly due to scheduling issues on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 . As a small publisher, they had to work with larger publishers to secure release slots months in advance, complicating coordination with other platforms. After the success of Back to the Future: The Game and Jurassic Park: The Game , Telltale achieved publisher status on Xbox Live, giving them more control over release timing. Additionally, they designed The Walking Dead so that episodes 2–5 would be treated as downloadable content , bypassing slot scheduling and enabling same-day release on PCs and consoles. The Walking Dead was initially announced as a five-episode series, with releases planned approximately on a monthly basis as digital downloads for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Originally slated for late 2011, the release was delayed until April 2012, coinciding with the conclusion of the second season of The Walking Dead television show, allowing the game to benefit from the show's growing popularity. Following the digital releases, Telltale Games announced a physical disc release for the complete series on December 11, 2012, for the same platforms. A special Collector's Edition was made available exclusively at GameStop in North America, featuring artwork by Charlie Adlard and The Walking Dead: Compendium One , a collection of the first 48 issues of the comic series by Robert Kirkman. After this retail release, some Xbox 360 users reported performance issues due to storage limitations, leading Telltale to offer free digital download codes as compensation. The game was also adapted for handheld consoles. An iOS version was launched in August 2012, followed by a PlayStation Vita port in March 2013. After releasing all five episodes on the App Store , Telltale offered the first episode for free, something they had done in the past, as doing so, according to Dan Connors, ""opens the funnel and gets it out to more people who can then convert into the [full] game"". In November 2013, Telltale announced a Game of the Year Edition , available for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, which included the five episodes, the 400 Days DLC, the original score, and a behind-the-scenes feature. A year later, in October 2014, versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released, with a Nintendo Switch version following in August 2018, which also included the 400 Days content. Additionally, a virtual pinball table based on The Walking Dead , developed in collaboration with Zen Studios , was released on August 27, 2014, as downloadable content for Zen Pinball 2 and Pinball FX 2 . This pinball adaptation featured designs representing set pieces from all five episodes and included animated models of characters Lee and Clementine. The Walking Dead ' s critical reception was ""generally favorable"", according to review aggregator website Metacritic , receiving a score of 89/100 based on 14 critic reviews. as it was praised for the harsh emotional tone, the characters, particularly the connection established between Lee and Clementine, story and the resemblance to the original comic book, though there was some criticism towards technical glitches. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer called the game ""a serious, solid, but clay-footed work"", while IGN 's Greg Miller called the game ""something special"" and named its story ""a tale no one should miss"".

IGN's Greg Miller gave it a 9 out of 10, saying ""It's a disturbing, depressing and entertaining entry in a journey that's been nothing short of excellent so far."" GameSpot gave the game an 8.5, saying "" The Walking Dead has passed the midway point of its series of five episodes with every indication that the game will keep getting better right through to its inevitably depressing and unsettling conclusion."" MTV also gave it a positive review, saying ""Telltale has created a series of wrenching, emotional decisions in the middle of a collection of not-too-hard puzzles in a visually-impressive adaptation of the Robert Kirkman comic series (with some nods to the TV show)."" ""Episode 4 – Around Every Corner"" received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PC version 84.00% and 80/100, the Xbox 360 version 82.50% and 82/100 and the PlayStation 3 version 78.94% and 81/100.

The Walking Dead achieved significant commercial success, supported by digital distribution. The first episode topped the Xbox Live Arcade charts for two weeks starting April 30, and it topped sales on PlayStation Network and Steam for a week. Within 20 days, it sold one million copies (excluding iOS), becoming Telltale's fastest-selling title. By the release of the third episode, 3.8 million episodes had been sold to 1.2 million players. By January 2013, sales exceeded 8.5 million episodes, generating about $40 million in revenue. Dan Connors noted that iOS accounted for 25% of sales, with significant growth in late 2012 driven by App Store discounts. By the release of 400 Days , over 17 million episodes had been sold worldwide, rising to 21 million by October 2013 and 28 million by July 2014. The Walking Dead has received numerous accolades from a variety of publications and organizations since 2012. It was recognized as ""Game of the Year"" by USA Today , Wired , GamesRadar+ , Official Xbox Magazine , Destructoid , Digital Trends , and Yahoo! Games . Following the success of the first series, Telltale began developing a second season , with the first episode released in late 2013. Connors stated they aimed to build on players' favorite elements from the first season, while considering story continuation and potential character ties to the TV show. In February 2013, Whitta hinted at additional content before Season Two , later revealed as 400 Days . Revealed at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released in July 2013, this content introduced five new characters and carried decisions from The Walking Dead into Season Two . Telltale released a three-episode mini-series, The Walking Dead: Michonne , in 2016. The first episode of Season Three, The Walking Dead: A New Frontier , launched in December 2016, followed by a physical season pass in February 2017. The fourth and final season, The Walking Dead: The Final Season , concluded in 2019. The Walking Dead has been credited with revitalizing the adventure game genre, which had experienced a decline in popularity since the 1990s. The game's emphasis on narrative-driven, choice-based gameplay is regarded as having ""paved the way"" for subsequent titles that adopted a similar approach, such as Life Is Strange and The Quarry , both of which focus on player choices and their impact on the story.",Telltale Games,"Episode 1 Windows, Mac OS X WW : April 24, 2012 PlayStation 3 NA : April 24, 2012 EU : April 25, 2012 Xbox 360 WW : April 27, 2012 iOS WW : July 26, 2012 Kindle Fire HDX WW : December 19, 2013 Episode 2 Xbox 360 WW : June 27, 2012 Windows, Mac OS X WW : June 29, 2012 [ 1 ] PlayStation 3 NA : June 29, 2012 EU : July 6, 2012 iOS WW : August 29, 2012 Kindle Fire HDX WW : December 19, 2013 Episode 3 PlayStation 3 WW : August 28, 2012 Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360 WW : August 29, 2012 iOS WW : October 28, 2012 Kindle Fire HDX WW : December 19, 2013 Episode 4 PlayStation 3 WW : October 9, 2012 Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360 WW : October 10, 2012 iOS WW : November 8, 2012 Kindle Fire HDX WW : December 19, 2013 Episode 5 PlayStation 3 WW : November 20, 2012 Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360 WW : November 21, 2012 iOS WW : November 20, 2012 Kindle Fire HDX WW : December 19, 2013 Retail version Mac OS X , Windows , PlayStation 3 & Xbox 360 NA : December 11, 2012 AU : May 9, 2013 EU : May 10, 2013 PlayStation Vita WW : August 22, 2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One NA : October 14, 2014 EU : October 31, 2014 Switch WW : August 28, 2018",Platforms Android iOS Kindle Fire HDX OS X Windows Nintendo Switch Ouya PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4 PlayStation Vita Xbox 360 Xbox One,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,daughter; labor,family; father; wife,suicide,infected,escape; escaped; prison,kill; killed; murder,,evil; witch,girl; young; young girl,
The Walking Dead: Season Two,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead%3A_Season_Two," The Walking Dead: Season Two is a 2013 episodic graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games based on the comic book series of the same name . It is the sequel to The Walking Dead , with the episodes released between December 2013 and August 2014. A retail collector's disc edition was released after the conclusion of the season. The game employs the same narrative structure as the first season, where player choice in one episode will have a permanent impact on future story elements. The player choices recorded in save files from the first season and the additional episode 400 Days carry over into the second season. Clementine , who was the player's main companion during the first season, returns as the main protagonist of Season Two . The Walking Dead: Season Two overall received generally positive reviews from critics; with particular praise going to the atmosphere, protagonist, and its sense of tension; however, its lack of hub areas, lack of impactful choices, and certain aspects of its storytelling received a mixed response. Many felt it was inferior to its predecessor. A third season, titled The Walking Dead: A New Frontier , was episodically released from December 2016 to May 2017. Similar to the previous season, The Walking Dead: Season Two is a point-and-click adventure game. The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees . Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine, which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to prevent Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails at these events, the game will restart at the start of the scene. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers. The player's choices and actions will impact story elements in later episodes; for example, a character that the player does not choose to save will not appear in later scenes. Season Two also incorporates the player's choices from the first season and the DLC 400 Days , via the saved game file from these games, to influence the story and events in these episodes. The Walking Dead: Season Two follows on the first game, and coincides with events of the comic, in which a zombie apocalypse has occurred, turning humans that are bitten or die into zombies, or ""walkers""; the only way to stop this conversion is to damage the brain. The game is mostly set more than a year following its predecessor. While the game starts in Georgia, the setting moves to more northern locales as the survivors head towards Michigan, believing there is a large survivor camp there. The second season follows Clementine ( Melissa Hutchison ), a young girl who has been able to survive the walkers thanks to the help of Lee Everett ( Dave Fennoy ). At the start of the apocalypse, Lee helps to protect Clementine and offers to help her find her parents who had gone to Savannah; they join several survivors in their journey. When Clementine is captured, a bitten Lee rescues her, but both realize her parents have become walkers. She is forced to choose between shooting him or leaving him to reanimate, before venturing off on her own. The second season features several new characters, as well as others returning from the first season. Clementine initially accompanies Omid (Owen Thomas) and Christa (Mara Junot), a couple who are the last known survivors of Clementine's previous group. She then encounters a cabin that shelters several survivors: Luke ( Scott Porter ), a survivalist who quickly befriends Clementine; Luke's friend Nick (Brian Bremer), and his uncle Pete ( Brian Sommer ), a hunter; doctor Carlos ( Kid Beyond ), who is protective over his teenage daughter Sarah (Louisa Mackintosh); and Alvin (Dorian Lockett) and his wife Rebecca (Shay Moore), who are expecting a child. The cabin group has fled from William Carver ( Michael Madsen ), a charismatic yet dangerous dictator who rules a large survivor group in Howe's Hardware. They later encounter another group of survivors, consisting of Kenny (Gavin Hammon), Clementine's friend who was believed to be killed by walkers; Sarita (Julia Farmer), Kenny's new girlfriend; and Kenny's friend, Walter ( Kiff VandenHeuvel ) and, Matthew (Wylie Herman). Both factions encounter Carver and his men, whose community includes Bonnie ( Erin Yvette ) and other survivors that were previously introduced in the 400 Days add-on content from the first season; Jane ( Christine Lakin ), a lone wolf who had lost her sister to walkers; and Mike (Dan White), a cranky yet humorous survivor. The latter part of the season introduces Arvo (Michael Ark), a Russian teenager with a leg brace who speaks in broken English, later shown to be part of a larger group of other Russian survivors. This is only a broad overview of the plot, and may differ based on the choices made during both this game and the preceding season and its add-on, 400 Days . After the events of the first game, Clementine regroups with Omid and Christa, but Omid is killed at a rest stop. Sixteen months later, Christa and 11-year-old Clementine are planning to travel to Wellington, Ohio but are separated when scavengers attack. After being saved from walkers, Clementine joins a new group consisting of Luke, Pete, his nephew Nick, Alvin, his pregnant wife Rebecca, Carlos, and his daughter Sarah. After Pete is killed by walkers, Clementine encounters a man named William Carver, the possible father of Rebecca's child, who is hunting down the group. Forced to abandon their cabin, the survivors find a ski lodge occupied by Clementine's old acquaintance Kenny, his girlfriend Sarita, and their friend Walter. Walkers attack the lodge, during which Nick is potentially killed. They are saved by the arrival of an armed group commanded by Carver. Carver executes Walter and possibly Alvin too, depending on Clementine's actions. Regardless, Carver's group captures everyone except Luke. Carver takes them to Howe's Hardware, a fortified mall that he tyrannically runs. Luke sneaks in Howe's and warns the others of an oncoming walker horde. The group, joined by two other survivors, Jane and Mike, and one of Carver's minions, Bonnie, devise a plan to escape by drawing the horde to the mall. During the chaos, Alvin (if alive) is killed by one of Carver's men, while Kenny kneecaps and brutally kills Carver in revenge for an earlier injury that had cost Kenny his left eye. The group makes their way through the walker horde by covering themselves in walker guts, but Carlos and Sarita are killed. Everyone gathers at the nearby ruins of a museum. Clementine and Jane set out to find Sarah, Luke, and Nick (if alive), who were separated amidst the horde. Clementine and Jane's search leads to a trailer park where Nick (if alive) has reanimated and Luke and Sarah are trapped by walkers. With Sarah catatonic due to her father's death, Clementine can either coerce her to leave with them or abandon her to be devoured. As Rebecca goes into labor, the survivors retreat to the museum's observation deck, which collapses and causes Sarah (if saved before) to fall and get killed. Rebecca gives birth to a boy whom Kenny names Alvin Jr., ""AJ"". Jane leaves the group out of fear of getting attached to Clementine. As the group heads north, they are ambushed by Russian survivors. When Rebecca dies of exhaustion and blood loss and turns, either Clementine or Kenny kills her to protect AJ, which starts a gunfight. Amidst the gunfight, Jane returns to save the others. Arvo, the sole Russian survivor, is left alive on the promise of supplies. He directs the group to a home across a frozen lake, but the ice breaks and Luke and potentially Bonnie fall through and drown. Kenny brutalizes Arvo, blaming him for Luke's death, which horrifies the others. They find a truck, planning to use it to leave the next morning. However, Clementine catches Arvo, Bonnie (if alive), and Mike attempting to escape from Kenny with the supplies, afraid of his increasing rage. Clementine is shot by Arvo and passes out. She awakens in the truck with Jane, Kenny, and AJ as they are heading north, the others having run off. The road is blocked amid a blinding blizzard and Kenny leaves to look for gas to siphon. Fed up with Kenny, Jane tries to convince Clementine to abandon him with her, but the two are separated by walkers. Clementine regroups with Kenny, but Jane then arrives without AJ, and it is implied she had to leave him behind. As an enraged Kenny fights and overpowers Jane, Clementine must decide whether to shoot Kenny to save Jane or allow Kenny to kill her. If Clementine kills Kenny, she then learns that Jane hid AJ and faked his death to manipulate Clementine into believing Kenny was unstable. Thereafter, Clementine can either forgive Jane and return to Howe's with her or refuse and set off alone with AJ. If Clementine instead allows Kenny to kill Jane, she then has the option of either killing or abandoning Kenny and leaving with AJ or forgiving Kenny and staying with him. If they stay together, the two eventually find Wellington, but the community's overpopulation forces Clementine to decide whether to enter with AJ and leave Kenny or stay with him. The game is separated into five episodes, like the first season. When Telltale Games acquired the right to make video games based on The Walking Dead comics , they signed a contract for a ""multi-year, multi-platform, multi-title"" license. This license went into effect after the success of the first season of The Walking Dead , when Telltale commissioned a second series of games based on the franchise. The first season was considered highly successful, helping to revitalize the adventure game genre, which had been in decline since the mid-1990s, with Telltale being recognized as one of the top development studios in 2012. During an interview on IGN ' s Up at Noon , writer Gary Whitta teased that more The Walking Dead from Telltale was coming sooner than later. Whitta continued to hint that something was in the works that would make the wait for Season Two ""slightly less agonizing"". This was revealed at E3 2013 to be an additional episode titled The Walking Dead: 400 Days , which would be released as downloadable content for the first season. It introduced five new characters, and decisions made in 400 Days would carry into Season Two . Writing for Season Two was done to contrast the work Telltale had completed in the first season. At the start of the writing cycle for the second season, they had debated who their primary character would be including introducing new group of survivors that they could use to flesh out the backstories of characters from the first season, or with a new ""protector"" for Clementine. They eventually agreed to use Clementine as the main character as they felt her story needed to be continued. By changing the player's perspective from that of Lee to Clementine, they wanted to create a ""different sort of agency"" that the player will experience. Instead of the player, as Lee, looking to help Clementine and others, the player as Clementine would now have to determine who to trust to help her. They also emphasize this new perspective by using several camera angles from a low perspective, to emphasize that Clementine is a child compared to others she meets. The developers also recognized that they needed to avoid making Clementine feel like a ""carbon copy"" of the character from the first season and instead something crafted by the player's decisions. To resolve this they created the first scenario of the game that would separate her from the familiar characters and to make it feel a result of the player's actions, so that the player would directly connect with Clementine's situation. The concept they kept in mind while writing for Season Two was ""[Clementine is] eleven years old and the world doesn't care."" As with the previous season, Telltale released Season Two for Windows and OS X computers, and for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, and iOS devices. Releases for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles were announced in May 2014 with release at a later date, along with retail versions of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. A Nintendo Switch version was released in 2020. The season was formally announced in late October 2013. The announcement showcased Clementine as the playable character for the game, set sometime after the events of the first series. Telltale's CEO Dan Conners stated that this would put ""players in the shoes of a lead role that will challenge their expectations of how to survive in a world where no one can be trusted"". The first episode was released in the fourth quarter of 2013, with subsequent episodes released four to six weeks apart. A collector's disc was announced to purchase at the end of the season, with those who pre-order the game (from the Telltale Games Store) receiving it for just the shipping and handling cost. On September 10, 2019, an official soundtrack album of Jared Emerson-Johnson 's B.A.F.T.A. Award nominated score to the game was released for digital download and on streaming services, with a special edition set of vinyl LPs due to release shortly thereafter. Telltale Games and Skybound Entertainment released spin off mini-series The Walking Dead: Michonne in February 2016. A third season titled The Walking Dead: A New Frontier was released with its first two episodes in December 2016, and a physical season pass in February 2017. The Walking Dead: Season Two overall received generally positive reviews from critics; with particular praise going to the atmosphere, protagonist, and its sense of tension; however, its lack of hub areas, lack of impactful choices, and certain aspects of its storytelling were criticized. Episode 1 – All That Remains received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 81.29% and 82/100, the PC version 78.76% and 78/100 and the Xbox 360 version 77.50% and 80/100. Matt Liebl from GameZone gave the episode an 8.5/10, stating that it ""...is just a taste of what's to come -- a mere setup for the horror that awaits us in the final four episodes."" Episode 2 - A House Divided received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 87.29% and 82/100, the PC version 81.39% and 81/100 and the Xbox 360 version 79.44% and 80/100.

Many critics praised Clementine's development while most criticisms were focused on some of the characters' cheap deaths and sub-par writing compared to the episode's predecessors. Episode 5 – No Going Back received positive reviews, higher than its predecessor.  Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 81.67% and 87/100, the PC version 79.19% and 78/100 and the Xbox 360 version 77.00% and 84/100. Mitch Dyer of IGN gave the episode a 9.5/10 saying that the finale is ""an impressive and intelligent episode, and among Telltale Games' finest stories.""",Telltale Games,"Episode 1 Windows, Mac OS X WW : December 17, 2013 [ 1 ] PlayStation 3 NA : December 17, 2013 [ 1 ] EU : December 18, 2013 [ 2 ] Xbox 360, iOS WW : December 18, 2013 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] PlayStation Vita WW : April 22, 2014 [ 5 ] Episode 2 Windows, Mac OS X WW : March 4, 2014 [ 6 ] PlayStation 3 NA : March 4, 2014 [ 6 ] EU : March 12, 2014 [ 7 ] Xbox 360 WW : March 5, 2014 [ 8 ] iOS WW : March 6, 2014 [ 8 ] PlayStation Vita WW : April 22, 2014 [ 5 ] Episode 3 Windows, Mac OS X WW : May 13, 2014 [ 9 ] PlayStation 3 NA : May 13, 2014 [ 9 ] EU : May 14, 2014 [ 10 ] Xbox 360 WW : May 14, 2014 [ 9 ] iOS WW : May 15, 2014 [ 9 ] Episode 4 Windows, Mac OS X WW : July 22, 2014 [ 11 ] PlayStation 3 NA : July 22, 2014 [ 11 ] EU : July 23, 2014 [ 11 ] Xbox 360 WW : July 23, 2014 [ 11 ] iOS WW : July 24, 2014 [ 11 ] Episode 5 Windows, Mac OS X WW : August 26, 2014 [ 12 ] PlayStation 3 NA : August 26, 2014 [ 12 ] EU : August 27, 2014 [ 12 ] Xbox 360 WW : August 27, 2014 [ 12 ] iOS WW : August 28, 2014 [ 12 ] Retail version Mac OS X , Windows , PlayStation 3 & Xbox 360 NA : October 14, 2014 AU : October 31, 2014 EU : October 24, 2014 PlayStation Vita WW : November 4, 2014 PlayStation 4, Xbox One NA : October 21, 2014 EU : October 31, 2014 Nintendo Switch WW : January 21, 2020","Windows , OS X , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , iOS , PlayStation Vita , PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Nintendo Switch , Ouya , Android",True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,birth; daughter; labor; pregnant,father; wife,,flesh,escape; locked,kill; killed,forced,witch,girl; teen; teenager; young; young girl,
The Walking Dead: The Final Season,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead%3A_The_Final_Season,"The Walking Dead: The Final Season is a 2018 episodic graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games and later Skybound Games , and the fourth and final main game in The Walking Dead video game series, based on the comic book series of the same name . Taking place some years after The Walking Dead: A New Frontier , the game focuses on Clementine 's efforts to raise young Alvin Jr. (AJ) in the post-apocalyptic world, coming to join with a group of troubled teenagers surviving out of their former boarding school. Their path leads them to encounter a hostile group of raiders led by a figure from Clementine's past. The game represents the first major release by Telltale after a major restructuring; it was aimed to return to themes and elements from the first season , and expected to be the concluding story for Clementine. The game was anticipated to be released over four episodes, with the first episode released on August 14, 2018, for the Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 4 , Windows , and Xbox One . However, due to the sudden closure of Telltale Games on September 21, 2018, the last two episodes were overseen by Skybound Entertainment , the production company of The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman , using as many of the former Telltale development team as possible, as Kirkman had felt it necessary to properly complete Clementine's story. As with other games in The Walking Dead series, The Final Season is a graphic adventure game, where the player controls the protagonist Clementine as she struggles to survive in the wake of a zombie apocalypse.  The player can move Clementine around the environment to examine and collect items and initiate conversation trees with non-player characters, and progress in the game. The Final Season introduces a collectible mechanic, where the player can collect certain items in the world and place them in their room later. Some collectibles can only be obtained on the basis of choices. For each episode, a certain amount of collectibles are to be found. Decisions made by the player can affect future episodes, and The Final Season can use previous saved games from The Walking Dead to bring a player's choices from these games into The Final Season . Players that have not played previous seasons, or who may want to adjust choices made affecting Clementine's character, will be able to use a web-based Story Builder tool to create a cloud-based save game that can be used to feed into the game. This also addresses issues with various save game limitations due to platform transitions over the course of the series. For example, previous saves from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the first two seasons are not compatible with The Final Season . The Final Season was included in The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series , which was released on September 10, 2019, for PS4, Xbox, and PC. It included graphical overhauls to the previous releases, concept art, and a way to carry over choices from previous seasons for players willing to play through each season. In portions of the game, the player will be required to react to quick time events in action-driven scenes, such as escaping from a ""walker"", the name for zombies in the series. Failure to complete the events typically results in the death of Clementine or another key character, requiring the player to retry the event. The Final Season introduces more open-ended action sequences that give the player more control during the sequence. The Final Season takes place roughly seven years after the events of the first one . It is set in the same continuity of the comic book series, and it is located in West Virginia , in a world where society has collapsed after a zombie outbreak . It once again stars Clementine ( Melissa Hutchison ), who is now an older teenager, after she has reunited with Alvin Jr., ""AJ"" ( Tayla Parx ), the son of Rebecca , and her efforts to raise and protect him in the post-apocalyptic world, similarly to how her past guardian and caretaker Lee Everett ( Dave Fennoy ) once did with her. Clementine and AJ join a group of teenage survivors inhabiting their former boarding school. They are led by Marlon ( Ray Chase ), and are made up by Louis (Sterling Sulieman), Violet ( Gideon Adlon ), Tennessee, ""Tenn"" (Zaire Hampton), Willy (Justin Cowden), Omar ( Keith Silverstein ), Ruby ( Ali Hillis ), Aasim ( Ritesh Rajan ), Brody ( Hedy Burress ), and Mitch ( Robbie Daymond ). The Delta is a faction of raiders who antagonize Clementine and the other children. Their members include Abel ( Alex Fernandez ), Minerva, ""Minnie"" ( Cherami Leigh ), one of Tenn's older sisters and Violet's ex-girlfriend, and Lilly ( Nicki Rapp ), a former member of Clementine's old survivor group from Macon, Georgia from the first season . Other characters in the game include James ( Johnny Yong Bosch ), a pacifistic ex- Whisperer , the children's pet dog Rosie, and Eddie (Brandon Bales), a character from the 400 Days DLC add-on for the first season, who briefly appears in a flashback. Shortly after the events of A New Frontier , Clementine rescues AJ from McCarroll Ranch after it is attacked, and is forced to kill AJ's caretaker in self-defense. Years later, Clementine has continued to raise AJ, recalling the lessons Lee taught her. While scavenging for food, the two end up in a car crash from which they are saved by a group of abandoned teenagers, operating from the ruins of Ericson's Boarding School for Troubled Youth. While acclimating to living in the school, Clementine and AJ return to scavenging and encounter a man named Abel, who tries to rob them. After informing the others at the school of their encounter, Clementine finds the group's leader Marlon having a heated argument with another resident, Brody. Brody reveals to Clementine that Abel is part of a raider group that Marlon had traded resident twin sisters Minerva and Sophie to in exchange for safety a year ago and that he also intends to trade her and AJ should the raiders return. Marlon accidentally kills Brody out of rage for revealing this and tries to frame Clementine for her death to the rest of the children. Clementine convinces the others of Marlon's wrongdoings, but before anything else can be done, AJ kills him. Clementine and AJ are evicted from the school. Outside, they are attacked by Abel and another member of the raiders, Lilly, the woman who either left or was banished from Lee's group during the first season. Lilly attempts to coerce Clementine to convince the other kids to join her group, but she refuses and escapes with AJ, which leads to AJ being shot. The pair are saved by James, a former member of the Whisperers, who tells them the raiders are forcibly recruiting people for a war against a rival community. Clementine returns to Ericson for medical treatment for AJ and to warn them about the raiders. The children prepare the school grounds for an attack. Two weeks later, the raiders arrive and though they are pushed back, they manage to kidnap some of the children and murder one of them. The children learn from a captured, dying Abel that the raiders have established camp in a nearby riverboat and with James' help, infiltrate the boat and plant a homemade bomb in its boiler before encountering Minerva, now a member of the raiders, who imprisons them with the others. Lilly confronts Clementine and reveals that Minerva killed Sophie when she tried to escape their group. Clementine incapacitates Minerva, frees the children, and fights Lilly into submission, who is then held at gunpoint by AJ. Clementine can tell him to kill or spare her; if spared, Lilly murders James. During the chaos, the bomb goes off and the ship explodes. Clementine and AJ escape the sinking boat as Lilly (if spared) flees on a raft while the other raiders are overwhelmed by walkers. If James is alive, he leaves the group after arguing with Clementine over AJ killing Lilly, potentially aiding their escape, depending on choices. Clementine, AJ, and Tenn meet with either Louis or Violet, who leads them back to Ericson. After reaching a partially collapsed bridge, the group is attacked by a bitten, crazed Minerva, who has led a horde of walkers to them. Clementine fights off Minerva, who slashes her ankle, and crosses the bridge with AJ. Louis or Violet try to make Tenn cross as well, but he is too stunned to move; if Clementine previously trusted AJ, putting the confidence in him to make hard decisions, he shoots Tenn to save Louis or Violet, otherwise, he will tell Louis or Violet to throw Tenn across the gap, thus saving him, but resulting in the other person getting devoured. While escaping the horde, a walker bites Clementine's wounded leg. Clementine and AJ take shelter in James' barn, which is quickly surrounded by walkers. A weakened Clementine urges AJ to escape on his own by covering himself in walker guts, then asks him to either kill her or leave her to turn. Regardless of her request, AJ swings Minerva's axe at her. Sometime later, it is revealed that AJ chose to amputate Clementine's leg, saving her life, and the two have finally found peace and a home at Ericson. The game is separated into four episodes, originally intended to be released every six weeks. Announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2017, The Walking Dead: The Final Season , was launched on August 14, 2018, for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with plans for a Nintendo Switch version to launch later that year. Clementine returned as the lead character, voiced by Melissa Hutchison, as Telltale found that fans of the series were not pleased with how little interactivity there was with Clementine in A New Frontier . Telltale wanted to have the final season call back to what fans had praised about the first season, and knew they needed to make Clementine the focus. With this direction, Telltale decided to make this the final season for The Walking Dead series so that they could create a satisfactory conclusion to Clementine's story arc. For this purpose, Telltale brought back Gary Whitta , the writer for the first season and 400 Days content, to help close out Clementine's story. The story followed from A New Frontier with Clementine having rescued AJ from the McCarroll Ranch, with an ellipsis a few years ahead, where AJ is now a young boy. Telltale had initially considered writing a version of Clementine that had become more jaded, but found this was far too different from the established version of the character, and reworked her to be more sympathetic. The Final Season used the updated version of the Telltale Tool first introduced in Batman: The Telltale Series , along with improvements in the visual style to approach the style used in The Walking Dead comic. This included improved dynamic lighting, and a new rendering style Telltale called ""Graphic Black"" to enforce the comic book rendering style. Some scenes featured ""unscripted"" zombies who may attack Clementine if the player is not careful, creating new freeform combat sequences, while other parts of the game used quick-time events as from previous games. Due to course-corrections made at Telltale in 2017, The Final Season was primarily the only game the company released that year, cutting down from twenty episodes across multiple games in 2017 to only this season's four in 2018. The game's executive producer Brodie Andersen said that ""We know we ran a little hot in previous years and weren't able to fully deliver the experiences we may have wanted to, so that was important to focus on polished quality experience players love."" Because of the reduced product schedule, Telltale was able to establish firm release dates for all four episodes in the season, a first for any of Telltale's episodic series. Andersen said that they were able to achieve this by starting from where they wanted The Final Season to end, and then building the narrative backward from that, establishing four clear episodes for the series to work towards. The game's story, with major plot points and milestones for all four episodes, were established early between creative director Kent Mudle, lead writer James Windeler, lead designer Mike Kirkbride, and seasoned writer Chris Rebbert, and which had little micromanagement from the new Telltale executives. A free demo of the game, offering approximately the first twenty minutes of the first episode, meant to show off the new gameplay features added in this season, was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on July 31, 2018. Despite the title, Telltale originally did not rule out a possible future for The Walking Dead games; creative director Kent Mudle said that the title represented the end of Clementine's journey from Telltale's view, but could revisit the franchise through other characters. On September 21, 2018, Telltale announced they were undergoing a ""majority studio closure"", laying off nearly all staff and leaving only 25 to complete the studio's remaining obligations. The news came as a shock to both the developers and voice actors working on the project. Melissa Hutchison, Clementine's voice actress, said that the cancellation was traumatic and she received the news in the midst of a recording session, which had to be cut short. The state of The Final Season was unknown, though other planned studio projects were cancelled. The second episode was still released on September 25, 2018, while those within Telltale stated that they were halfway through completing the third episode when the news broke; they had cleared the narrative with Skybound and had done the first pass of voice work for the episode. Telltale stated on September 24, 2018, that the studio was approached by ""multiple potential partners"" that wanted to help bring these two episodes to completion in some manner. Until they were able to figure out how the last two episodes would be played out, Telltale asked retailers and digital storefronts to pull sales of the game and the season pass. At that time, Skybound Entertainment , the publishing company that Kirkman started to support licensing of The Walking Dead and other properties, were starting to explore a video game division, and had started a small Skybound Games division led by Ian Howe around five months before Telltale's closure. Skybound had already been working closely with Telltale prior to their first The Walking Dead season to help Telltale figure out the type of story they wanted to tell, inspired by the comic book's approach. This led to creating the video game series with a focus on a singular character, Clementine. In return, Skybound gained an appreciation of what interactive experiences and video games mean alongside all the other venues (comics, television, and so forth) they were exploring, and saw it as an essential element of their ""Wheel of Awesome"" to extend The Walking Dead and their other properties into other markets. The intent of Skybound Games was to work with third-party developers, rather than hosting its own development team. When Telltale announced its closure, Skybound Entertainment saw the potential of using this to kickstart Skybound Games. According to Howe, Kirkman had said after Telltale contacted them about the news that that Skybound should just get Clementine's story finished as her character partially influenced how Skybound would expand its businesses. Howe traveled to meet with the 50-some developers that had been working on The Final Season , and explained the situation, in that Skybound was interested in supporting the game through completion, and wanted the original Telltale team on board to support this, but could not promise any sustained job afterward and being upfront about what they did not know at that time. Finding that most of the Telltale team were eager to help finish out the game, Howe's team began to seek out the financial and other logistical support needed. They acquired the rights to the Telltale The Walking Dead games, and were able to negotiate with the landlord of the former Telltale offices to establish working space there as to minimize any disruption to the team members and not require them to relocate. Other Telltale members made personal sacrifices to make sure the game got done, and Skybound did as much as possible to support these members, and provided allowances for team members to continue to search for jobs following the game's completion. Not all of the Telltale team stayed on due to the lack of long-term job security or had already accepted other job offers. Overall, it took about two months from Telltale's closure in September for Skybound to complete all the preparations and legal requirements to restart development. According to Mudle, who stayed with the Telltale team in transitioning to Skybound, the final episode of the series was always meant to be treated as a closure to one era of Telltale as they were transitioning to a new engine with plans for new mechanics to break the mold of their adventure game approach; the last episode was to have included hints of these new mechanics. Following the studio closure, the final episode became more poignant, leaving some of those elements in but otherwise treating it as a tribute to Telltale's legacy. However, continuing the development at Skybound was aided by all the planning work they had done at Telltale, according to Mudle, making the transition less difficult. Kirkman officially announced Skybound's involvement in finishing The Final Season during the 2018 New York Comic Con in October. Skybound announced in November 2018 that the former Telltale team, now named ""Still Not Bitten Team"", had restarted work on The Final Season . Howe had anticipated that the third episode would be released before the end of 2018. Spanish and Portuguese voice dubbing for the remaining episodes was dropped for budgetary reasons. Skybound also affirmed that they gained the rights to sell the former The Walking Dead games, and would not require anyone that had already purchased a season pass for The Final Season to buy one again once the last two episodes were released. Users that had purchased the title before Telltale's closure on Steam or on GOG would receive the final episodes on those platforms, but otherwise, the season was moved to the Epic Games Store for all new purchasers. According to Skybound, Epic Games had helped with the season's completion following Telltale's closure, and thus Skybound felt it was necessary to offer the game through their platform. Skybound produced a physical release of The Final Season for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on March 26, 2019; the season pass disc contains the first three episodes and grants access to download the remaining episode. Following the completion of the major development, about 15 team members remained at Skybound to help support bug and console fixes. Skybound explored options of either keeping the remaining team aboard once they had completed all essential work or potentially spinning them off as a separate studio that would work with Skybound Games in the future. On September 10, 2019, an official soundtrack album of Jared Emerson-Johnson 's score to the game was released for digital download and on streaming services, with a special edition set of vinyl LPs due to be released shortly thereafter. The Walking Dead: The Final Season received generally positive reviews, earning praise for its characters, visuals, and upgraded gameplay mechanics, and is generally considered by critics and fans to be both an improvement over the previous two seasons and a return to form for the series.

Theresia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresia_%28video_game%29,"Theresia ( テレジア ) , known in Japan as Theresia: Dear Emile , is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game developed by WorkJam and published by Aksys Games , released exclusively for the Nintendo DS . It is one of the few DS games to receive an ESRB rating of M for ""Mature"" and a CERO rating of C from ""ages 15 and older"", and is the fifth of 11 DS games overall to be issued the former rating for a North American release. The game follows an amnesiac teenager named Leanne wandering an abandoned military installation, trying to regain her memories and escape while avoiding traps designed to kill her. Theresia was released on September 11, 2008, in Japan and on October 30, 2008, in North America. Arc System Works acquired the rights to the series in 2017. The game is the second release of a mobile phone game series of the same name. The DS version contains a remake of the original phone title, renamed as ""Dear Martel."" Theresia is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game from a first-person perspective, consisting of two stories, each sharing a common background: an unnamed country, presumably under strict martial law by the time the game takes place, is engaged in a fierce and bloody war with an unspecified opposing nation. No further details are provided: the player is then thrust directly into the role of Leanne, the protagonist of the first half of the story. Upon completion of the main game, a shorter second chapter is unlocked, consisting of a remake of the series' original phone game. Featuring an unnamed protagonist, it provides a deeper insight into the overarching background narrative. Throughout the course of the game, both characters have to explore their confinements, trying to escape and learn the details of their past, avoiding traps and coming face-to-face with personal demons and other psychological dilemmas along the way. The game makes use of the Nintendo DS touchscreen capabilities. Gameplay is divided into two modes: a movement mode, where the player navigates the facility and searching for different rooms, and an observational mode, in which the player investigates certain areas and solves puzzles. During the latter mode, the player may activate traps that harm the player and reduce their life bar . Only careful observation or usage of a found 2x4 can reveal them to the character to prevent harm. The player can regain lost health via the use of found elixirs. Leanne, a teenage girl wakes up in a small, dim room with no memories. The only clue is the word Theresia scribbled upon a piece of paper. The first areas of the game instruct the player on the controls, set the atmosphere and introduce the survival aspect. The building is not only the sub-basement of a larger complex, but also riddled with hidden traps. Most doors are locked, barricaded, or blocked by environmental hazards. Leanne discovers she is in an underground prison facility, which stretches over several underground stories and includes waterworks, storage and torture rooms, and unknown crypts. In the upper levels, more of the setting and Leanne's background are revealed: the country is losing the war, and the prison is part of a military installation which includes a testing laboratory, run by a woman named Maylee, who Leanne has seen in flashbacks. She also has flashbacks of a young man named Sacha and a silver-haired woman drenched in blood. Evidence reveals that the testing was of an enemy's bioweapon, known to cause uncontrollable bleeding, high fever, madness, amnesia, and ultimately death as the body swells and turns purple. After the death of an infected, it becomes an airborne virus named Epicari. To stop Epicari from spreading, the bodies would be burned. Leanne heads toward the surface, until reaching the commander's office. Along the way, journal entries and notes cause Leanne to have flashbacks and recover pieces of her memory. She remembers she was the sole survivor of a village destroyed in the war. Growing up at the church, she longed to talk to a young boy named Sacha, but her foster mother, Emile, made her promise never to talk to anyone but her. Sacha and Leanne exchanged letters in secret. When Emile discovered Sacha embracing Leanne, she ran at him with a knife, killing another church member who got in the way. Emile was restrained and taken to the underground part of the facility and was no longer allowed to visit Leanne. Epicari had begun to surface, killing many people. Maylee and a group of scientists created a cure from Emile's blood, called ""Theresia"" after her last name. The virus continued to spread and the military moved everyone underground to their base. Sacha tried to convince Leanne to run away with him, as the two had fallen in love, but Leanne couldn't forget Emile. She asked Maylee to take her to see her mother. Emile chained Leanne and locked her in a prison cell but Leanne was happy to be with her mother again. Eventually, the military ordered mass executions to finally stop the virus. Sacha came to release a reluctant Leanne, but was discovered by Emile. He pointed a gun at her, but she calmed him down by singing him a lullaby she often sang to an infant Leanne. She took his gun and killed him. She tried to escape with Leanne, assisted by Maylee, who had come to care for them. Emile murdered many of her own comrades to protect her daughter. Remembering this, Leanne realizes her mother really did love her. Leanne eventually becomes infected with Epicari. Maylee gave her the vaccine, Theresia, made from her mother's blood, which gave her amnesia. Emile was the one who left her journal entries. She also set up the traps, attempting to keep Leanne safe from others, and to keep her from escaping. In the commander's office, Leanne finds her mother's body and mourns. She takes the final key needed for her escape, which her mother had seemingly been protecting. Casting aside her possessions, along with the pendant her mother had given her, Leanne escapes the facility. Outside, she finds an abandoned infant which she resolves to take. After the credits, the camera zooms in on Leanne kneeling outside with the baby, Emile standing behind her. There is a strange noise, and the camera falls over. The game takes place sometime before the events of Dear Emile. It starts with the protagonist waking up in a room with no memories of his past. The protagonist is unnamed. Martel was the name of his sister, who had a different father than him. After the death of their mother soon after she was born, he sent her to an orphanage ran by their grandfather. He was adopted and continued his studies. Years later, he returns to the orphanage to be a doctor and to do research. He is reunited with Martel, who has grown into a kind, beautiful young woman. The two seem to get along well. He also becomes friends with two other doctors there Franz and Maylee. The doctor becomes very happy with his new family. The doctors unknowingly create the Epicari virus and infect the children. As the virus spreads, they request help from the government. Soldiers come, but only to forcibly take samples from the children. The orphanage is then quarantined. As more and more children die, the doctor, Franz, and Maylee struggle to find a cure. Martel buries the dead children without fear of being infected herself, and the fact that she doesn't eventually leads to the creation of the vaccine Theresia from her blood. By this time, Franz was unknowingly infected with Epicari. He had suddenly started hiding his face, claiming he hated how he looked. One of the symptoms of the virus was the exacerbation of personal issues, but because they falsely believed the virus only affected children, they didn't realize this until it was too late. Eventually he went mad and attacked people with an axe. When his mask fell off, he killed himself by ramming his face into the axe embedded in the wall. Though they finally managed to create the vaccine, the place was stormed by soldiers. The staff tried to tell them that they now had a cure, the soldiers were relentless and used flamethrowers to massacre all the children and many of the staff. The doctor managed to hide with Martel, but was separated from Maylee. She ultimately survived, going on to try and create more of the vaccine as shown in Dear Emile's story. When everything was over, the doctor and Martel left their hiding places. A disheveled and slightly bloody Martel stepped on and killed an insect without realizing it. The doctor, who was unknowingly suffering from Epicari himself, snaps from this sight and strangles her. He buries her amongst the red flowers she had grown outside the orphanage. Knowing he will soon forget, the doctor leaves the notes and journal entries to remind him what he has done. He also sets up the traps and writes the messages on the wall, as a way to punish himself for what he has done. The game ends with the protagonist obtaining the vaccine and getting back his memories. After exiting the orphanage, he desperately tries to dig up Martel's body but cannot find it. He is happened upon by Maylee, who talks with him. A sequel to the original game, entitled Theresia II: Dear Lizst , was released in Japan for mobile phones. Little is known about the sequel, and the game is widely considered to be lost media. It was removed from app stores in 2012 along with other versions of Theresia, when WorkJam closed down. Theresia was developed by the Japanese company WorkJam , which was most notable for the Jake Hunter series. It was first announced on February 11, 2008, set to be published by Arc System Works in Japan. It was speculated that the game would be localized for North America upon announcement. Western Release Aksys Games confirmed the game would receive a North American release in a press release on July 7, 2008. Associate Marketing Manager Harry Chang noted that the female protagonist [Leanne] ""loves her mom... a lot."" which was perceived as ""incesteous"" and unusual by one publication. The game was released on November 3, 2008. Theresia received ""mixed or average"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Critics praised its plot, sound and cutscenes but criticized its gameplay and design flaws. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one six, for a total of 28 out of 40. Alex Lucard of diehardgamefan.com gave Theresia a positive review, saying that “[Theresia] features one of the best stories you’ll find in a game this year, some amazing hand drawn art, creepy puzzles, and an atmosphere second to none.” Daemon Hatfield of IGN gave it a 7.1/10 or “good” review, explaining that “Theresia offers a mature, high-concept Nintendo DS experience that, while frustrating at times, might provide adventure gamers with the fix they need.” Henry Gilbert from GamesRadar+ was very critical of the game, rating it a 4/10. He comedically noted that the best part of the game was “finally solving some annoying puzzle, putting down DS and staring at clouds.”",WorkJam,"JP : September 11, 2008 NA : October 30, 2008",Nintendo DS,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,baby; daughter; infant; labor; mother,family; father,,body; infected; memories,chained; escape; locked; prison; restrained,forcibly; kill; killed; murder; murdered; torture,,,girl; teen; teenage girl; teenager; young,
Tormented Souls,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tormented_Souls," Tormented Souls is a 2021 survival horror video game developed by Dual Effect and published by PQube for PlayStation 5 , Windows and Xbox Series X/S . The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were cancelled in February 2021 but were eventually released in February 2022. A sequel, Tormented Souls 2 , was released in 2025. Tormented Souls is a third-person survival horror game in the style of the original Resident Evil with fixed camera angles and optional ""tank"" controls . The player explores an abandoned hospital and can interact with the environment and certain NPCs , solve puzzles, and use improvised weapons to combat monsters that inhabit the hospital. The story begins in December 1994 with Caroline Walker, a Canadian woman, receiving a photograph in the mail of two twin girls, Anna and Emma, that prompts her to find out what is happening with them. She tracks them down to the abandoned Wildberger Hospital in order to find answers, but is ambushed and knocked unconscious upon arrival. When she awakens, she discovers that her right eye has been surgically removed. With the aid of a priest, Caroline explores the hospital to discover who the twins are. During her investigation, she finds strange VHS tapes that allow her to travel into the past. In the past, she encounters Anna, who explains that she has been imprisoned by her grandfather. Eventually, Caroline discovers her own childhood bedroom and remembers that she is Emma, rendered amnesiac fourteen years prior while escaping from the hospital, and vows to rescue Anna. In order to bypass a door that requires the biometrics of twins to open, she travels to the past to take her eye from her past self. On the other side of the door, Caroline confronts the priest, revealed to be her maternal grandfather Noah and the man responsible for the events at the hospital. Noah has been attempting to sacrifice twins in order to resurrect a monstrous ""savior""; he attempted to do the same to Anna and Emma in childhood, but their mother stopped him and escaped with Emma. Caroline also discovers that in the present day, Anna has been mutated into a horrific monster. Caroline pursues Noah to the ""savior""'s chamber, where he offers his own blood up to resurrect it. Caroline kills the ""savior"" in combat. The game's ending depends on Caroline's final interaction with the present Anna. If she ignores Anna, Anna ambushes her as she departs the hospital. If she discovers an antidote for Anna's mutation and mercy kills her, Caroline grieves her family before leaving. The canonized ending depicts Caroline traveling back to the past one last time and rescue the past Anna from her captivity. Caroline swears to explain everything to Anna one day and adopts her.

Unforgiving: A Northern Hymn,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgiving%3A_A_Northern_Hymn,"Unforgiving: A Northern Hymn is a survival horror game from Swedish -based independent game company; Angry Demon Studio. The game is in Swedish with English subtitles and is heavily inspired by Swedish folklore and Norse mythology . It was released on Windows on November 27, 2017. The gameplay is open world and survival horror from a first-person perspective . The setting is a forest and the player is also given a chance to explore various cabins, abandoned buildings , and an abandoned mine shaft . The game is also dimly-lit obscuring potential threats from the player's vision and uses sound to manipulate the player into questioning the presence of enemies. The game also features an AI that chooses its own paths instead of repeating the same path to increase the game's unpredictability. The game begins with protagonist Linn waking up tied in the back of her brother Lukas' car. After kicking Lukas in the back of the head in order to escape, Lukas crashes, leaving both lost in the woods and working together to seek a means of escape. Shortly after the car crash, Linn learns the reason Lukas kidnapped her. He explains he was simply trying to help her with her addiction, which she had refused to seek treatment for. He planned to take her to a cabin to help her begin to recover. Linn and Lukas soon get separated while crossing a river. Linn then crosses a swamp area, fixing a fuse box and outrunning a specter in the process. Once the fuse box is repaired, she crosses the river on a tram car and is re-united with her brother, after evading a one-armed troll. After being reunited, the brother and the sister are spotted by the troll and forced to flee; Lukas is caught under rubble and Linn is forced to kill him. Linn is left alone and without a flashlight, meaning that she now must rely on light from matchsticks found in matchboxes throughout the game. After leaving her brother, Linn comes across a village of abandoned houses, where she finds her first matchbox. After picking up her first matchbox, the phone rings in the house and an unknown voice who addresses a message to someone named ""Ragnar"" tells her to go ""toward the light"" to a mine over the lake, and that she must cross the lake by playing a song to tell a guardian at the lake to send a boat. While in the village, Linn also encounters what appear to be humanoid figures trapped inside of trees. After she leaves the house, Linn then hears a disembodied whisper that asks her to find Freyja 's golden harp in order to call the boat. She soon finds the harp inside another abandoned building in the village, called the Hall of the Harp. Inside the Hall of the Harp, Linn finds Freyja's harp placed upon an altar, but is met with a disembodied voice telling the player that an offering of fire and an offering of blood must be placed on the altar before the harp can be taken. After making these offerings, Linn is able to take the harp, which allows her to play it in order to complete tasks such as opening doorways. After the player leaves the Hall of the Harp, Linn outruns the figure of a Skogsrå who screams and sprints after her. She then places the harp on an outdoor altar, and a disembodied voice tells her that she must place an offering of one eye and an offering of one tongue on this altar. She obtains the eye and the tongue from her brother's corpse, and then completes the ritual, allowing her to play longer songs with the Harp. Linn then plays the harp on the bridge, intending to call upon the guardian to bring the boat. However, the Skogsrå appears again and bites her. Tendrils then begin to form on her arm, implying that the bite has caused her to begin slowly transforming into one of the humanoid tree-spirits. The boat then appears, and while on the boat trip across the lake, Linn sees the Näcken playing his violin on the shore. He speaks, and tempts her by saying he can relieve her pain if she gives him Freyja's harp. The boat does not stop, and she continues sailing past as the Näcken hysterically laughs. On the other side of the lake, Linn once again encounters the one-armed troll. She progresses by playing the harp in a manner corresponding to notes scattered around the area, all while evading the troll, before then escaping by running into an abandoned mine shaft. Within the mine, she is forced to set light to a tree spirit that resembles a mother and child that is blocking the way forward, even as the mother voice begs for her not to do it. After evading an area containing trolls, Linn enters an isolated area on a cliff-side with scattered reminders of her addiction, including needles, bottles of morphine , and pills. A disembodied voice encourages her to jump, and she does so, finding herself in a nightmare-like space that is pitch black with walls covered in large red eyes. Here, the Näcken reappears and again offers the exchange of the harp for the relief of her pain. Linn assents, handing him the harp. The Näcken removes Linn's bite as promised, but says that she now must find her way out. Linn then runs towards a light while avoiding being crushed by giant hands that appear from the walls. Once she reaches the light, she reappears in the back of her brother's car. The disembodied voice of the Näcken then explains that he has the protagonist trapped in an endless loop, because he enjoys watching her suffer over and over again. As his voice fades, Linn begins to forget the previous loop, and begins kicking her brother in the back of the head while he's driving, beginning the cycle anew.",Angry Demon Studio,"November 27, 2017",Windows,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,mother,,,,escape; kidnapped,kill,forced,,,

Wilson's Heart,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_Heart_%28video_game%29,"Wilson's Heart is a virtual reality horror adventure video game by Twisted Pixel Games , released on April 25, 2017. The game is compatible with the Oculus Rift virtual reality platform. Wilson's Heart is a virtual reality horror adventure played in the first person perspective and in black and white . The player must use motion controllers to interact with objects in the game world and to teleport between certain, predetermined places in the world which are indicated by ghostly images of the player character. The player can open doors and drawers, pick up and manipulate certain objects and combine certain objects. The game contains a rudimentary inventory system which allows the player to store certain objects. The game will then present the objects to the player automatically when they can be used. During the game, the player obtains several abilities which allow them to manipulate objects from a distance: they can turn on lamps, draw metallic objects to them using magnetism and use a throwing weapon which automatically returns to them after usage. Several times during the game the player is attacked by enemies and must fight them. Each fight consists of the player repeating a certain pattern of action to defend from the enemy's attack and then attacking themselves, e.g. blocking punches with their arms and then punching the enemy when he is exhausted. Robert Wilson ( Peter Weller ), a middle aged man, awakes in a seemingly abandoned, damaged hospital wearing nothing but a hospital gown . While stumbling through the hospital looking for help, he encounters a living murderous teddy bear and the body of a Dr. Harcourt, who seemed to be an important figure in the hospital. Then Wilson finds a book which seems to contain depictions of supernatural phenomena. He then encounters a group of survivors: Bela Blasco ( Alfred Molina ), who claims to be a surgeon in the hospital; Elsa Wolcott ( Rosario Dawson ), a young woman; Kurt Mosby ( Michael B. Jordan ), who claims to be a visitor in the hospital; and Lucy Holmes, a prepubescent 9 year old girl. Elsa explains that Dr. Harcourt was researching supernatural phenomena and the book contains the result of his research. Bela then notices that Wilson has in his chest, in place of his heart, a strange orb containing moving parts. The group then surmises that the orb must have something to do with the strange phenomena in the hospital and that the book could help fight those phenomena and return Wilson's heart to him. Unfortunately, several pages of the book are missing, having been torn recently. Shortly after, Wilson loses contact to the others by Shadow Beings and is on his own again. But he notices that he can take the device out of his chest and perform tasks with it, like turning on failing light sources. He also finds more and more missing pages from the book and notices that the more pages he finds, the more tasks his orb is able to perform. He meets the group again later but shortly after loses contact again. When he later meets Kurt again, Kurt admits that he was a patient in the hospital and is a werewolf , before fleeing again. When Wilson meets Elsa again, she is taken away by a large humanoid monster (That resembles that of Frankenstein's Monster ). When Wilson meets Lucy again, he realizes, to his utter shock, that she is a vampire when she murders and drinks the blood of a hospital orderly. She wants the book to no longer look like a young girl, Wilson manages to chase her away. After stumbling through the hospital and encountering and defeating several creatures like a tentacle monster , the teddy bear, a zombie soldier , a human-fly hybrid, Mutant Fishmen and animated wooden dummies, Wilson is knocked out by the humanoid monster which took away Elsa earlier and wakes up shackled in a large laboratory. There he encounters Elsa who explains that she was the wife and scientific partner of Dr. Harcourt, and that the humanoid monster is in fact her young son named Andy, whose original body had been irreparably damaged by an accident for which Dr. Harcourt was responsible. She had put Andy's brain in a monstrous body to preserve it and now needs Wilson's orb as a new power source for his body, and the book to perform a procedure which will install the orb in Andy's body. While she is preparing the procedure, Kurt sneaks into the laboratory and tries to free Wilson, but he is prevented from doing so by the full moon, which appears in the window and transforms him into his werewolf form, and he is attacked by Andy. While the two are fighting, Bela sneaks in and tries to free Wilson, just when Lucy in vampire-form flies in. Andy defeats and incapacitates Kurt in werewolf-form and then fights with Lucy, who in turn defeats and incapacitates Andy, just as Bela manages to free Wilson. Wilson manages to stake and kill Lucy before she can bite him. He then manages to reach the book and burn it, just when Andy wakes up. In the chaos, Wilson manages to give Andy an electric shock which overloads his brain, leading him to throw Elsa out of the window. Wilson then manages to stun Andy and puts his orb inside his brain, where it electrocutes Andy. Later Wilson wakes up in the restored hospital, his heart having been implanted back into his chest. He talks to Bela, who says that the orb and Kurt are missing and that Elsa and Andy's brain have died. Wilson explains that he had been in the hospital to donate his heart to his little brother, who has a family. He makes Bela promise that his brother will never know who had donated the heart. The game ends with Wilson breathing in the narcotic for the heart transplant operation and falling unconscious. A post-credits scene shows Kurt meeting a mysterious figure who seems to be part of a group who fights supernatural beings. Kurt hands over the orb to the figure, and requests as a price that the person help him lose his lycanthropy . Wilson's Heart received ""generally favorable"" reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Reviewers commended the black-and-white graphics, campy horror atmosphere and voice acting, but they criticized the trivial puzzles, limited and arbitrary interactivity, illogical story and repetitive and frustrating fight sequences. The game was nominated for ""Best VR Game"" in Destructoid ' s Game of the Year Awards 2017.",Twisted Pixel Games,"April 25, 2017",Windows,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,labor,family; wife,,body,shackled,kill; murder,,creature; monster; vampire,girl; young; young girl,
